The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

functor,"
                The term 'functor' has several common meanings:  

1. Function object. In object-oriented languages, it is a feature that allows objects to be used like if they were ordinary functions.

2. A mathematical structure which deals with mappings between categories.  This concept is a useful abstraction in some programming languages, notably Haskell, where it is implemented as a type class.

3. In OCaml, a module that takes another module as an argument.

bubble-sort,"
                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

                An exception is an unusual condition that requires deviation from the program's normal flow. Normally, an exception should not result in total failure, but instead be attended by an exception handler. Exception handling is a built-in construct in many programming languages. Usually, exceptions are handled by unwinding the stack, thus rolling back to a defined state outside the exception's scope, and then invoking a handler block or routine.

                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

selection-sort,"
                In computer science, a selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.

                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

It has O(n2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.

                In computer science, a selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.

                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

This tag should be used for questions involving the use of pointers, not references. The most common programming languages using pointers are C, C++, Go, and assembly languages. Use a specific language tag. Other helpful tags are method, function, struct, etc. describing the use of pointer.

bubble-sort,"
                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

bubble-sort,"
                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

functor,"
                The term 'functor' has several common meanings:  

1. Function object. In object-oriented languages, it is a feature that allows objects to be used like if they were ordinary functions.

2. A mathematical structure which deals with mappings between categories.  This concept is a useful abstraction in some programming languages, notably Haskell, where it is implemented as a type class.

3. In OCaml, a module that takes another module as an argument.

Linked lists offer O(1) insert after and removal of any element with known memory location, O(1) list concatenation, and O(1) access at the front (and optionally back) positions as well as O(1) next element access. Random access and random index insertion/removal have O(n) complexity and are usually unimplemented.

bubble-sort,"
                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

linked-list,"
                A linked list is a data structure in which the elements contain references to the next (and optionally the previous) element. Linked lists offer O(1) insert after and removal of any element with known memory location, O(1) list concatenation, and O(1) access at the front (and optionally back) positions as well as O(1) next element access. Random access and random index insertion/removal have O(n) complexity and are usually unimplemented.

binary-search-tree,"
                A binary search tree is a data structure which consists of a root node with left and right child nodes. The left node and all of its descendants have smaller values than the root node, while the right node and all of its descendants have larger values than the root node. The children of the root node follow this same pattern. This gives us a tree consisting of ordered elements.

bubble-sort,"
                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

                A binary search tree is a data structure which consists of a root node with left and right child nodes. The left node and all of its descendants have smaller values than the root node, while the right node and all of its descendants have larger values than the root node. The children of the root node follow this same pattern. This gives us a tree consisting of ordered elements.

                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

exception,"
                An exception is an unusual condition that requires deviation from the program's normal flow. Normally, an exception should not result in total failure, but instead be attended by an exception handler. Exception handling is a built-in construct in many programming languages. Usually, exceptions are handled by unwinding the stack, thus rolling back to a defined state outside the exception's scope, and then invoking a handler block or routine.

bubble-sort,"
                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

bubble-sort,"
                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

median,"
                The median is the 'middle' value from a set of values. If the number of values is an even number, the median is the mean of the 'middle' values.

                An exception is an unusual condition that requires deviation from the program's normal flow. Normally, an exception should not result in total failure, but instead be attended by an exception handler. Exception handling is a built-in construct in many programming languages. Usually, exceptions are handled by unwinding the stack, thus rolling back to a defined state outside the exception's scope, and then invoking a handler block or routine.

                Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements ""bubble"" to the top of the list. It is little used in industry but useful in teaching.

                A binary search tree is a data structure which consists of a root node with left and right child nodes. The left node and all of its descendants have smaller values than the root node, while the right node and all of its descendants have larger values than the root node. The children of the root node follow this same pattern. This gives us a tree consisting of ordered elements.

simd,"
                Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) is the concept of having each instruction operate on a small chunk or vector of data elements.  CPU vector instruction sets include: x86 SSE and AVX, ARM NEON, and PowerPC AltiVec. To efficiently use SIMD instructions, data needs to be in structure-of-arrays form and should occur in longer streams. Naively ""SIMD optimized"" code frequently surprises by running slower than the original.

                A binary search tree is a data structure which consists of a root node with left and right child nodes. The left node and all of its descendants have smaller values than the root node, while the right node and all of its descendants have larger values than the root node. The children of the root node follow this same pattern. This gives us a tree consisting of ordered elements.

It can change from one state to another when initiated by a triggering event or condition; this is called a transition.
