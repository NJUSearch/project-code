1572427,Problem with Berkeley DB and C++,"
I'm trying to write a simple C++ program that uses Berkeley DB for storage. The key of the database is of type time_t and the data is an integer.
I need to take the difference between two adjacent data in a between two key. I open a cursor with the flag DB_SET_RANGE and then i use DB_NEXT to iterate.
My problem is that the cursor returns unsorted data. Is there a way to specify a custom sorter function for the cursor?

1557570,How can I sort a list when the sorting criterion requires an extra variable? C++,"
this is for an assignment so I will be deliberately general. My question is related to implementation decisions I already made--maybe they weren't good ones.
I have a list of pointers to structs, e.g. list<MyStruct*> bob; At one point I've needed to sort these pointers by one of the data members of their targets and I was able to do that easily with
And then calling bob.sort(sortbyarrival); Works great.
Now somewhere else I need to sort by a different criterion, which involves a counter in the program. I need something like return counter*a->arrival < counter*b->arrival; But the way I just described is the only way I know how to do a sort, I think, and I don't know how to pass my counter as an additional argument. How can I sort this list of pointers?
ETA: The counter is just a variable in main. So ideally I could call something like bob.sort(sortbyratio, counter); or sort(bob.begin(), bob.end(), sortbyratio, counter);

My current problem is that I've a full map<std::string,int> which I'm not going to use anymore. I just need to extract 10 pairs in value(int) order and destroy it.
The best thing, if it was possible, would be to sort it in place and then iterate it 10 times, but that apparently is not a solution.
I'm trying different solutions as going through a multimap<int,string> (to allow duplicate keys), but I'd like to know if there is a more elegant solution, using stl algorithms as much as posible.

I'm using a map because for the 99% of the time, I need it as a map: fast key lookups to increase values. Just need a good way of later extracting in value order when I don't need the map anymore.

std::copy the map(std::string,int) to a vector(pair(std::string,int))
sort the vector

I have a huge array of ints that I need to sort. The catch here is that each entry in the list has a number of other associated elements in it that need to follow that int around as it gets sorted. I've kind of solved this problem by changing the sorting to sort doubles instead of ints. I've tagged each number before it was sorted with a fractional part denoting that value's original location before the sort, thus allowing me to reference it's associated data and allowing me to efficiently rebuild the sorted list with all the associated elements.
My problem is that I want to sort the double values by ints using the function stable_sort(). 
I'm referring to this web page: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/stable_sort/
However, since I'm a new programmer, i don't quite understand how they managed to get the sort by ints to work. What exactly am i supposed to put into that third argument to make the function work? (i know i can just copy and paste it and make it work, but i want to learn and understand this too).

1271367,Radix Sort implemented in C++,"
I am trying to improve my C++ by creating a program that will take a large amount of numbers between 1 and 10^6. The buckets that will store the numbers in each pass is an array of nodes (where node is a struct I created containing a value and a next node attribute). 
After sorting the numbers into buckets according to the least significant value, I have the end of one bucket point to the beginning of another bucket (so that I can quickly get the numbers being stored without disrupting the order). My code has no errors (either compile or runtime), but I've hit a wall regarding how I am going to solve the remaining 6 iterations (since I know the range of numbers). 
The problem that I'm having is that initially the numbers were supplied to the radixSort function in the form of a int array. After the first iteration of the sorting, the numbers are now stored in the array of structs. Is there any way that I could rework my code so that I have just one for loop for the 7 iterations, or will I need one for loop that will run once, and another loop below it that will run 6 times before returning the completely sorted list?

1238191,SORT Integer Array TAG a STRUCTURE Array (or two),"
So the idea is to sort a large STRUCTURE using an element of that structure, for arguments sake Zip Code.
To keep it simple lets pretend that there are two arrays, one integer containing the zip codes and two, a larger structure (3k Bytes) array. 
Sorting the integer array is suitably fast with Quick Sort, but tagging the Structure array could be done a little better than simply swapping elements when the integer array swaps elements.
In testing a random 3000 element integer array required 12000 swaps to achieve a completed sort. Swapping the entire structure that many times would have a performance penalty esp if there are many elements.
Ideally I would just sort an array of pointers, but in this case I actually have to return a sorted structure array not an array of sorted pointers. If nothing else this is an exercise in sorting a tagged array.
One approach would be to tag a secondary integer array, and then use the order within it to shuffle the elements of the structure around, thus moving each element only once.
I am not finding much help on the web

This isn't exactly what our code looks like since I know this example could be optimised in different ways, however it gives you an idea of how performance could be a problem because I'm sorting after every push_back.
I think I essentially have two options to improve performance:

Use a (hand crafted?) insertion sort instead of std::sort to improve the sort performance (insertion sorts on a partially sorted vector are blindingly quick)
Create a heap by using std::make_heap and std::push_heap to maintain the sort order

My questions are:

Should I implement an insertion sort?  Is there something in Boost that could help me here?
Should I consider using a heap?  How would I do this?


Edit:
Thanks for all your responses.  I understand that the example I gave was far from optimal and it doesn't fully represent what I have in my code right now.  It was simply there to illustrate the performance bottleneck I was experiencing - perhaps that's why this question isn't seeing many up-votes :)
Many thanks to you Steve, it's often the simplest answers that are the best, and perhaps it was my over analysis of the problem that blinded me to perhaps the most obvious solution.  I do like the neat method you outlined to insert directly into a pre-ordered vector.

1132175,"Custom sorting, always force 0 to back of ascending order?","
Premise
This problem has a known solution (shown below actually), I'm just wondering if anyone has a more elegant algorithm or any other ideas/suggestions on how to make this more readable, efficient, or robust.
Background
I have a list of sports competitions that I need to sort in an array.  Due to the nature of this array's population, 95% of the time the list will be pre sorted, so I use an improved bubble sort algorithm to sort it (since it approaches O(n) with nearly sorted lists).  
The bubble sort has a helper function called CompareCompetitions that compares two competitions and returns >0 if comp1 is greater, <0 if comp2 is greater, 0 if the two are equal.  The competitions are compared first by a priority field, then by game start time, and then by Home Team Name.  
The priority field is the trick to this problem.  It is an int that holds a positve value or 0.  They are sorted with 1 being first, 2 being second, and so on with the exception that 0 or invalid values are always last.
e.g. the list of priorities
0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 3, 0
would be sorted as 
1, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0
The other little quirk, and this is important to the question, is that 95% of the time, priority will be it's default 0, because it is only changed if the user wants to manually change the sort order, which is rarely.  So the most frequent case in the compare function is that priorities are equal and 0.
The Code
This is my existing compare algorithm.  
Question
How can this algorithm be improved?
And more importantly...
Is there a better way to force 0 to the back of the sort order?  
I want to emphasize that this code seems to work just fine, but I am wondering if there is a more elegant or efficient algorithm that anyone can suggest.  Remember that nPriority will almost always be 0, and the competitions will usually sort by start time or home team name, but priority must always override the other two.

274951,Chaining of ordering predicates (e.g. for std::sort),"
You can pass a function pointer, function object (or boost lambda) to std::sort to define a strict weak ordering of the elements of the container you want sorted.
However, sometimes (enough that I've hit this several times), you want to be able to chain ""primitive"" comparisons.
A trivial example would be if you were sorting a collection of objects that represent contact data. Sometimes you will want to sort by last name, first name, area code. Other times first name, last name - yet other times age, first name, area code... etc
Now, you can certainly write an additional function object for each case, but that violates the DRY principle - especially if each comparison is less trivial.
It seems like you should be able to write a hierarchy of comparison functions - the low level ones do the single, primitive, comparisons (e.g. first name < first name), then higher level ones call the lower level ones in succession (probably chaining with && to make use of short circuit evaluation) to generate the composite functions.
The trouble with this approach is that std::sort takes a binary predicate - the predicate can only return a bool. So if you're composing them you can't tell if a ""false"" indicates equality or greater than. You can make your lower level predicates return an int, with three states - but then you would have to wrap those in higher level predicates before they could be used with std::sort on their own.
In all, these are not insurmountable problems. It just seems harder than it should be - and certainly invites a helper library implementation.
Therefore, does anyone know of any pre-existing library (esp. if it's a std or boost library) that can help here - of have any other thoughts on the matter?

As mentioned in some of the comments - I've gone ahead and written my own implementation of a class to manage this. It's fairly minimal, and probably has some issues with it in general. but on that basis, for anyone interested, the class is here:

Problem
I have timestamped data, which I need to search based on the timestamp in order to get the one existing timestamp which matches my input timestamp the closest.
Preferably this should be solved with the STL. boost::* or stl::tr1::* (from VS9 with Featurepack) are also possible.

Approach with stl::vector, sort() and equal_range()
Since a map or set only allows me to find exact matches, I don't get any further using one of these.
So now I have a vector to which I append data as it is coming in. Before searching I use <algorithm>'s sort() and supply it with a custom comparison function.
After that I use <algorithm>'s equal_range() to find the two neighbors of a specified value x.
From these two values I check which one is closest to x and then I have my best match.

While this is not too complex, I wonder if there are more elegant solutions to this.
Maybe the STL already has an algorithm which does exactly that so I'm not re-inventing something here?
Update: Linear vs. binary search
I forgot to mention that I have quite a lot of data to handle so I don't want to have to search linearly.
The reason I am sorting a vector with sort() is because it has random access iterators which is not the case with a map. Using a map would not allow equal_range() to do a search with twice logarithmic complexity.
Am I correct?

Does anyone know a library class sorted_vector, which basically has a similar interface to std::set, but inserts elements into the sorted vector (so that there are no duplicates), uses binary search to find elements, etc.?
I know it's not hard to write, but probably better not to waste time and use an existing implementation anyway.
Update: The reason to use a sorted vector instead of a set is: If you have hundreds of thousands of little sets that contain only 10 or so members each, it is more memory-efficient to just use sorted vectors instead.

In the end I just want to sort the list of pointer-pairs such that all of the duplicates are next to each other.

2105737,Has anyone seen this improvement to quicksort before?,"
Handling repeated elements in previous quicksorts
I have found a way to handle repeated elements more efficiently in quicksort and would like to know if anyone has seen this done before. 
This method greatly reduces the overhead involved in checking for repeated elements which improves performance both with and without repeated elements. Typically, repeated elements are handled in a few different ways which I will first enumerate. 
First, there is the Dutch National Flag method which sort the array like [ < pivot | == pivot | unsorted | > pivot]. 
Second, there is the method of putting the equal elements to the far left during the sort and then moving them to the center the sort is [ == pivot | < pivot | unsorted | > pivot] and then after the sort the == elements are moved to the center. 
Third, the Bentley-McIlroy partitioning puts the == elements to both sides so the sort is [ == pivot | < pivot | unsorted | > pivot | == pivot] and then the == elements are moved to the middle. 
The last two methods are done in an attempt to reduce the overhead.
My Method
Now, let me explain how my method improves the quicksort by reducing the number of comparisons. 
I use two quicksort functions together rather than just one. 
The first function I will call q1 and it sorts an array as [ < pivot | unsorted | >= pivot]. 
The second function I will call q2 and it sorts the array as [ <= pivot | unsorted | > pivot]. 
Let's now look at the usage of these in tandem in order to improve the handling of repeated elements. 
First of all, we call q1 to sort the whole array. It picks a pivot which we will further reference to as pivot1 and then sorts around pivot1. Thus, our array is sorted to this point as [ < pivot1 | >= pivot1 ]. 
Then, for the [ < pivot1] partition, we send it to q1 again, and that part is fairly normal so let's sort the other partition first. 
For the [ >= pivot1] partition, we send it to q2. q2 choses a pivot, which we will reference to as pivot2 from within this sub-array and sorts it into [ <= pivot2 | > pivot2]. 
If we look now at the entire array, our sorting looks like [ < pivot1 | >= pivot1 and <= pivot2 | > pivot2]. This looks very much like a dual-pivot quicksort. 
Now, let's return to the subarray inside of q2 ([ <= pivot2 | > pivot2]). 
For the [ > pivot2] partition, we just send it back to q1 which is not very interesting. 
For the [ <= pivot2] partition, we first check if pivot1 == pivot2. If they are equal, then this partition is already sorted because they are all equal elements! If the pivots aren't equal, then we just send this partition to q2 again which picks a pivot (further pivot3), sorts, and if pivot3 == pivot1, then it does not have to sort the [ <= pivot 3] and so on. 
Hopefully, you get the point by now. The improvement with this technique is that equal elements are handled without having to check if each element is also equal to the pivots. In other words, it uses less comparisons.
There is one other possible improvement that I have not tried yet which is to check in qs2 if the size of the [ <= pivot2] partition is rather large (or the [> pivot2] partition is very small) in comparison to the size of its total subarray and then to do a more standard check for repeated elements in that case (one of the methods listed above).  
Source Code
Here are two very simplified qs1 and qs2 functions. They use the Sedgewick converging pointers method of sorting. They can obviously can be very optimized (they choose pivots extremely poorly for instance), but this is just to show the idea. My own implementation is longer, faster and much harder to read so let's start with this:
I know that this is a rather simple idea, but it gives a pretty significant improvement in runtime when I add in the standard quicksort improvements (median-of-3 pivot choosing, and insertion sort for small array for a start). If you are going to test using this code, only do it on random data because of the poor pivot choosing (or improve the pivot choice). To use this sort you would call:
Some Benchmarks
If you want to know just how fast it is, here is a little bit of data for starters. This uses my optimized version, not the one given above. However, the one given above is still much closer in time to the dual-pivot quicksort than the std::sort time. 
On highly random data with 2,000,000 elements, I get these times (from sorting several consecutive datasets):
Where std::sort is the C++ Standard Library sort, the dual-pivot quicksort is one that came out several months ago by Vladimir Yaroslavskiy, and qs1/qs2 is my quicksort implementation.
On much less random data. with 2,000,000 elements and generated with rand() % 1000 (which means that each element has roughly 2000 copies) the times are:
There are some instances where the dual-pivot quicksort wins out and I do realize that the dual-pivot quicksort could be optimized more, but the same could be safely stated for my quicksort.
Has anyone seen this before?
I know this is a long question/explanation, but have any of you seen this improvement before? If so, then why isn't it being used?

2099436,A few sorting questions,"
I have found a way that improves (as far as I have tested) upon the quicksort algorithm beyond what has already been done. I am working on testing it and then I want to get the word out about it.  However, I would appreciate some help with some things. So here are my questions. All of my code is in C++ by the way.

One of the sorts I have been comparing to my quicksort is the std::sort from the C++ Standard Library. However, it appears to be extremely slow. I am only sorting arrays of ints and longs, but it appears to be around 8-10 times slower than both my quicksort and a standard quicksort by Bentley and McIlroy (and maybe Sedgewick). Does anyone have any ideas as to why it is so slow? The code I use for the sort is just 
std::sort(a,a+numelem); 
where a is the array of longs or ints and numelem is the number of elements in the array. The numbers are very random, and I have tried different sizes as well as different amounts of repeated elements. I also tried qsort, but it is even worse as I expected.
Edit: Ignore this first question - it's been resolved.
I would like to find more good quicksort implementations to compare with my quicksort. So far I have a Bentley-McIlroy one and I have also compared with the first published version of Vladimir Yaroslavskiy's dual-pivot quicksort. In addition, I plan on porting timsort (which is a merge sort I believe) and the optimized dual-pivot quicksort from the jdk 7 source. What other good quicksorts implementations do you know about? If they aren't in C or C++ that might be okay because I am pretty good at porting, but I would prefer C or C++ ones if you know of them.
How would you recommend getting out the word about my additions to the quicksort? So far my quicksort seems to be significantly faster than all other quicksorts that I've tested it against. The main source of its speed is that it handles repeated elements much more efficiently than other methods that I've found. It almost completely eradicates worst case behavior without adding much time in checking for repeated elements. I posted about it on the Java forums, but got no response. I also tried writing to Jon Bentley because he was working with Vladimir on his dual-pivot quicksort and got no response (though I wasn't terribly surprised by this). Should I write a paper about it and put it on arxiv.org? Should I post in some forums? Are there some mailing lists to which I should post? I have been working on this for some time now and my method is legit. I do have some experience with publishing research because I am a PhD candidate in computational physics. Should I try approaching someone in the Computer Science department of my university? By the way, I have also developed a different dual-pivot quicksort, but it isn't better than my single-pivot quicksort (though it is better than Vladimir's dual-pivot quicksort with some datasets). 

I really appreciate your help. I just want to add what I can to the computing world. I'm not interested in patenting this or any absurd thing like that.

I'm trying to obtain the top say, 100 scores from a list of scores being generated by my program. Unfortuatly the list is huge (on the order of millions to billions) so sorting is a time intensive portion of the program. 
Whats the best way of doing the sorting to get the top 100 scores? 
The only two methods i can think of so far is either first generating all the scores into a massive array and then sorting it and taking the top 100. Or second, generating X number of scores, sorting it and truncating the top 100 scores then continue generating more scores, adding them to the truncated list and then sorting it again. 
Either way I do it, it still takes more time than i would like, any ideas on how to do it in an even more efficient way? (I've never taken programming courses before, maybe those of you with comp sci degrees know about efficient algorithms to do this, at least that's what I'm hoping).
Lastly, whats the sorting algorithm used by the standard sort() function in c++?
Thanks, 
-Faken
Edit: Just for anyone who is curious...
I did a few time trials on the before and after and here are the results:
Old program (preforms sorting after each outer loop iteration):
new program (implementing tracking of only top scores and using default sorting function):
new rewrite (optimizations in data stored, hand written sorting algorithm):
Done on a core 2, 1.6 GHz...I can't wait till my core i7 860 arrives...
There's a lot of other even more aggressive optimizations for me to work out (mainly in the area of reducing the number of iterations i run), but as it stands right now, the speed is more than good enough, i might not even bother to work out those algorithm optimizations.

I wonder if you can use the same approach in that you step backward in a linked list to find the position it should be inserted into.
If it is possible how do you loop a linked list backward? I can't figure it out because it seems not possible since it should be a double linked listed then if I'm not wrong? Anyway I'm working with singly linked list.
EDIT
I think I'm going for the look forward approach, this is what I made so far. I'm stuck at that point in how I should save the previous (key, value). Here's the code so far of what's done. The for-loop is used to look for the position I want to insert to. And I have peek forward, which will break in case it reach the end.
OK so far, now I want to insert the value to the correct position. It is here I'm stuck. How should it be done? Now when I insert keys: 2, 1, 0, 3, it will only print out 1, 3

3164034,"Sort, pack and remap array of indexed values to minimize overlapping","
Sitation:
overview:
I have something like this:
I need to sort values, remap indexes, and recalculate ranges to minimize maxValueIndex-minValueIndex for each range.
details:
values is an array(okay, ""vector"") of some type (irrelevant which one). elements in values may be unique, but this is not guaranteed.
indexes is an vector of ints. each element in ""indexes"" is an indexes that correspond to some element in values. Elements in indexes are not unique, one value may repeat multiple types. And indexes.size() >= values.size().
Now, ranges correspond to a ""chunk"" of data from indexes. firstElement is an index of element to be used from indexes (i.e. used like this: indexes[range.firstElement]), numElements is (obviously) number of elements to be used, minIndex is mininum in (indexes[firstElement]...indexes[firstElement+numElements-1]) a,d maxIndex is maximum in (indexes[firstElement]...indexes[firstElement+numElements-1]). Ranges never overlap. 
I.e. for every two ranges a, b
Obviously, when I do any operation on values (swap to elements, etc), I need to update indexes (so they keep pointing on the same value), and recalculate corresponding range, so range's minIndex and maxIndex are correct.
Now, I need to rearrange values in the way that will minimize Range.maxIndex - Range.minIndex.  I do not need the ""best"" result after packing, having ""probably the best"" or ""good"" packing will be enough.
problem:
Remapping indexes and recalculating ranges is easy. The problem is that I'm not sure how to sort elements in values, because same index may be encountered in multiple ranges.
Any ideas about how to proceed?
restrictions:
Changing container type is not allowed. Containers should be array-like. No maps, not lists.
But you're free to use whatever container you want during the sorting.
Also, no boost or external libraries - pure C++/STL, I really neeed only an algorithm.
additional info:
There is no greater/less comparison defined for SomeType - only equality/non-equality.
But there should be no need to ever compare two values, only indexes.
The goal of algorithm is to make sure that output of 
Will be identical before and after sorting, while also making sure that for each range 
Range.maxIndex-Range.minIndex (after sorting) is as small as possible to achieve with reasonable effort.
I'm not looking for a ""perfect"" or ""most optimal"" solution, having a ""probably perfect"" or ""probably most optimal"" solution should be enough.
P.S. This is NOT a homework.

3095000,How to monitor/show progress during a C++ sort,"
I'm planning to write an interactive C++ geometry processing plug-in that will frequently sort large amounts of data.  Although preliminary indications are that the sort will take only a second or two, I'd prefer to show progress during that time - i.e I'd like to update a progress indicator a few times per second.  This would be preferable to turning on a wait cursor and leaving the user with a program the freezes for an indeterminate length of time (even if that's just a few seconds).
If I were to use something like std::sort, I could use the comparison function to update the progress indicator every now and then, but I'd have no idea of 'percentage complete'.  I could also break the sort down into sub-sorts, updating progress between sub-sorts, and then merging.  My best bet may be to write own sort method, although I don't know how much effort it would require to get performance as good as std::sort (and ensure correctness). In any case, that sort method would occasionally send a ""percentage complete"" to a callback method. 
I was wondering whether other people have encountered and solved this problem - I'm hoping that maybe there's a sort method in a standard library that does what I want, or some other technique that I haven't thought of.
Update: Thanks for the great answers so far.  There have been a few very good suggestions, and I'm going to hold off on choosing the accepted answer until I've had a chance to test out the ideas in my upcoming project.

How to make it return size of array, not its pointer ?
Next the most important : add() for adding new elements. Inside first I get the size of array (but hence it returns value of pointer, and not size it's of no use now :/). Then I think I must check if TYPE of data is char. Or am I wrong ? 
Am I thinking correct here ?
Last functions show() is correct I guess :
and problem with sort() is as follows : Ho can I influence if sorting is decreasing or increasing ? I'm using bubble sort here.
And main function to run it :

Update: I have a couple of what are probably silly questions about commenter 6502's answer (below).  If anyone could help, I'd really appreciate it.  
1) I understand that data 1 and data 2 are the maps, but I don't understand what allkeys is for.  Can anyone explain?  
2) I know that: data1[vector1[i].name] = vector1[i].value; means assign a value to the map of interest where the correct label is...  But I don't understand this: vector1[i].name and vector1[i].value.  Are't ""name"" and ""value"" two separate vectors of labels and values?  So what are they doing on vector1?  Shouldn't this read, name[i] and value[i] instead?
Thanks everyone.

I have written code for performing a calculation.  The code uses data from elsewhere.  The calculation code is fine, but I'm having trouble manipulating the data.
The data exist as sets of vectors.  Each set has one vector of labels (names, these are strings) and a corresponding set of values (doubles or ints).  
The problem is that I need each data set to have the same name/label in the same column as the other data sets.  This problem is not the same as sorting the data in the vectors (which I know how to do) because sometimes names/labels can be missing from some vectors.  
For example:
Data set 1:
vector names1 = Jim, Tom, Mary 
vector values1 = 1    2    3
Data set 2: 
vector names2 = Tom, Mary, Joan
vector values2 = 2    3     4
I want (pseudo-code) ONE name vector that has all possible names.  I also want each corresponding numbers vector to be sorted the SAME way:
vector namesUniversal = Jim, Joan, Mary, Tom
vector valuesUniversal1 =  1    0     3     2
vector valuesUniversal2 = 0    4     3     2   
What I want to do is come up with a universal vector that contains ALL the labels/names sorted alphabetically and all the corresponding numerical data sorted too.
Can anyone tell me whether there is an elegant way to do this in c++?  I guess I could compare each element of each name vector with each element of each other name vector, but this seems quite clunky and I would not know how to get the data into the right columns in the corresponding data vectors.  Thanks for any advice.

4806827,"C++: Defined my own assignment operator for my type, now .sort() wont work on vectors of my type?","
I have a class (those that have read Accelerated C++ may find this class familiar) defined as follows:
A function calculator() makes use of objects of this type. As a part of the function, a vector of (already declared) Student_info objects is sorted using the library's generic sort function. My program does not progress past this point (though according to NetBeans no exceptions are thrown and the program exits correctly).
The sort function makes heavy use of the assignment operator of whatever type is held in the container, but I can't seem to find out what's wrong with the one I defined (the program was functioning properly before I defined it). According to Accelerated C++ (or at least this is how I interpreted it), the proper way the assignment operator is supposed to work is to first destroy the left operand, and then construct it again with a value equal to the right operand. So this is my overloaded operator= definition:
As you can see, it invokes the Student_info copy constructor, which is defined below:
The copy constructor functions correctly, because ommiting the sort statement allows the program to function correctly and yield a copyCount (which is only modified in the copy constructor and operator=) greater than 0.
So what exactly is wrong with my assignment operator? It has to do with the destruction of the calling Student_info object, but I don't know how to rectify it short of NOT destroying it.
(And by the way, the creation of the copy constructor, destructor, and assignment operator are called for by an exercise in Accelerated C++... I realize that the synthesized versions of these functions would obviously suffice for my class)

4775203,Best sorting algorithm for sorting structs with byte comparisons?,"
I have an array of 64 structs that hold a decent amount of data (struct is around 128 bytes, so that's 8192 bytes that need to be re-arragned). The array needs to be sorted based off a single unsigned byte in each struct. An interesting property of my data is that it is likely that there will be many duplicates of sorted value - meaning that if you got rid of all duplicates, the array may only be 10 unique elements long, but this is not a given.
Once sorted, I need to create a stack that stores the size and type that each unique byte-run starts:
so if I ended up with sorted values:
4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,14,14
the stack would be:
(4,3), (9,5), (14,2)
I figured that there would be some nice optimizations I could perform under these conditions. If I do heapsort, I can create the stack while I'm sorting, but would this be faster than a qsort and then build the stack afterwords? Would any sorting algorithm run slower because of the large structs I'm using? Any optimizations I can make because I'm only comparing bytes?
BTW: language is c++

4328513,Quicksort with a twist in c++,"
When sorting an array of objects some objects might swap places. This can by very expensive in terms of time and space, as each swap requires to copy an object.
In some cases sorting the entire array is not required. For example: Given an array of times for a marathon. The array should be sorted that the fastest 200 times are correctly sorted at the start of the array. Similarly one might be interested in the order of the 100 worst times. Important here is that the array apart from the top and the buttom does not have to be sorted.
The function that you should implement not only takes a pointer to the array of a template class and the size of that array as parameters. It also takes two further parameter front and end . The function will change the given array so that the first front elements are the smallest in the entire array and that these front elements are sorted. Similarly, the highest end elements are at the end of the array and also these end elements are sorted. Any other elements don't have to be sorted.
Example, for an array [""michael"", ""sam"", ""chris"", ""tom"", ""anna"", ""nick"", ""brian"", ""lisa""] and front =2 and end =3 
the array after calling the function might be [""anna"", ""brian"", ""michael"", ""lisa"", ""chris"", ""nick"", ""sam"", ""tom""] 
Note, it is important that first two names are ""anna"" and ""brian"", as well as the array finishes with ""nick"", ""sam"", ""tom""
Finally the function will take two further parameters of type int which are passed by reference. When the function finishes these will contain the number of swaps and the number method calls during the run of the function.
The function declaration is
    template < class T> void quickSort(T * array,int size,
      int front, int end, int & calls, int & swaps) 
Your function should be based on the quicksort algorithm. Hence you will need to write an addition function which contains recursive calls. To count the number of swaps and calls you should use global variables.
Can anyone help me in this?

this is linear in N (as it's bigger than M), but the temporary variable and repeated copying bugs me. Is there a way to do it quicker than this? Note that M will be close to N, so things that are O(M log N) are unfavourable.
Edit: http://ideone.com/xR8Vp is a sample implementation of mentioned algorithm, to make the desired output clear and prove that it's doable in linear time - the question is about the possibility of avoiding the temporary variable or speeding it up in some other way, something that is not linear is not faster :).

5786296,"Overloading comparision operator in C++ results in ""invalid operator<""","
Currently attempting to sort a vector of object, with each object containing a string, in C++
The strings can contain letters or numbers (due to a design constraint, this is necessary, as the comparator can be changed).
At the moment, the class of the object is overloaded, so that when two objects are compared, the strings they contain are compared. This works to a point -- however, when I use a sort operation (such as STL sort) to put the objects in order, it will sort three strings such as ""1"", ""4"", ""12"", in the order ""1"", ""12"", ""4"". 4 is greater then 12, but because it begins comparing from the most left digit, this 'incorrect' sort occurs.
My initial response was to change how I was overloading the comparison operation. I would first check the length of the string I was comparing -- which would be a telltale sign if the string's contents was larger or smaller.
This operation results in a ""Expression: invalid operator<"" message during runtime.
Any ideas as to where I am making a mistake? It seems that I should be able to dictate to the operation exactly how I want the sorting operation to occur -- even if it is invalid, since I am currently using a vector to contain the objects.

The problem:
N nodes are related to each other by a 'closeness' factor ranging from 0 to 1, where a factor of 1 means that the two nodes have nothing in common and 0 means the two nodes are exactly alike.
If two nodes are both close to another node (i.e. they have a factor close to 0) then this doesn't mean that they will be close together, although probabilistically they do have a much higher chance of being close together.

The question:
If another node is placed in the set, find the node that it is closest to in the shortest possible amount of time. 
This isn't a homework question, this is a real world problem that I need to solve - but I've never taken any algorithm courses etc so I don't have a clue what sort of algorithm I should be researching.
I can index all of the nodes before another one is added and gather closeness data between each node, but short of comparing all nodes to the new node I haven't been able to come up with an efficient solution. Any ideas or help would be much appreciated :)

I'm trying to optimize the loading process, and I'm having trouble.  I suspect the problem is with frequent re-balancing, and I'm looking for a way to avoid that.
First, I did it with no optimization, using ""set->insert (const value_type& x )""

Then I tried using the version of insert() where you pass in a hint for the location of the insert():
Roughly, I did this:

The only thing I can think of is that the set is constantly re-balancing.

2.) Is there a way to ""pause"" the rebalancing while I load the set, and then rebalance once at the end?  (Or... Would that even help?)

7126201,Optimized way to find M largest elements in an NxN array using C++,"
I need a blazing fast way to find the 2D positions and values of the M largest elements in an NxN array.
right now I'm doing this:
A Point struct is just two ints - x and y.  
This code basically does an insertion sort of the values coming in.  maxValues[0] always contains the SourcePoint with the lowest value that still keeps it within the top M values encoutered so far.  This gives us a quick and easy bailout if sample <= maxValues, we don't do anything.  The issue I'm having is the shuffling every time a new better value is found.  It works its way all the way down maxValues until it finds it's spot, shuffling all the elements in maxValues to make room for itself.  
I'm getting to the point where I'm ready to look into SIMD solutions, or cache optimisations, since it looks like there's a fair bit of cache thrashing happening.  Cutting the cost of this operation down will dramatically affect the performance of my overall algorithm since this is called many many times and accounts for 60-80% of my overall cost.
I've tried using a std::vector and make_heap, but I think the overhead for creating the heap outweighed the savings of the heap operations.  This is likely because M and N generally aren't large.  M is typically 10-20 and N 10-30  (NxN 100 - 900).  The issue is this operation is called repeatedly, and it can't be precomputed.
I just had a thought to pre-load the first M elements of maxValues which may provide some small savings.  In the current algorithm, the first M elements are guaranteed to shuffle themselves all the way down just to initially fill maxValues.
Any help from optimization gurus would be much appreciated :)

7100044,Inserting and removing elements from an array while maintaining the array to be sorted,"
I'm wondering whether somebody can help me with this problem. I'm using C/C++ to program and I need to do the following:
I am given a sorted array P (biggest first) containing floats. It usually has a very big size.. sometimes holding correlation values from 10 megapixel images. I need to iterate through the array until it is empty. Within the loop there is additional processing taking place. 
The gist of the problem is that at the start of the loop, I need to remove the elements with the maximum value from the array, check certain conditions and if they hold, then I need to reinsert the elements into the array but after decreasing their value. However, I want the array to be efficiently sorted after the reinsertion.

7038838,"How to sort two arrays/vectors in respect to values in one of the arrays, using CUDA/Thrust","
This is a conceptual question in regards programming. 
To summarize, I have two arrays/vectors and I need to sort one with the changes propagating in the other as well, so that if I sort arrayOne, for each swap in the sort - the same thing happens to arrayTwo. Now, I know that std::sort allows you to define a comparison function (for custom objects I assume) and I was thinking of defining one to swap arrayTwo at the same time.
So what I want is - to sort the two vectors based on values in one of the vectors, using CUDA.
This is where my uncertainty rises, essentially I want to use the Thrust library to do the sort. Does it support the definition of a custom comparison function? If so, I still haven't figured out how to propagate the change in the arrayTwo though (since it will be CUDA based).
I really don't have the time to implement a custom parallel quicksort on CUDA, as much as I should/want to.
The reason
Essentially I need to perform sorting and calculation on a bunch of arrays of variables versus a single array (think regression trees). Naturally, I need to do so as quickly as possible, CPU based sort is just not quick enough.
#UPDATE
I should emphasize, I have no problems sorting the two on the host, I'm looking for a solution that uses CUDA. Thanks.
#UPDATE 2
I think I actually got lucky and found the solution since I posted the question,
turns out Thrust actually provides exactly what I'm looking for by default:
*taken from http://code.google.com/p/thrust/wiki/QuickStartGuide#Fancy_Iterators*
So, now all I have to do is get two thrust::device_vectors out of the two arrays (that I have to get out of the 2D array). Happy.

std::sort swaps elements by using std::swap, which in turn uses the copy constructor and assignment operators, guaranteeing that you get correct semantics when exchanging the values.
qsort swaps elements by simply swapping the elements' underlying bits, ignoring any semantics associated with the types you are swapping.
Even though qsort is ignorant of the semantics of the types you are sorting, it still works remarkably well with non-trivial types. If I'm not mistaken, it will work with all standard containers, despite them not being POD types.
I suppose that the prerequisite for qsort working correctly on a type T is that T is /trivially movable/. Off the top of my head, the only types that are not trivially movable are those that have inner pointers. For example:
If you sorted an array of NotTriviallyMovable then the m_someElements would end up pointing to the wrong elements.
My question is: what other kinds of types do not work with qsort?

The Implementation File: (Undirected_Graph.cpp)
Now in the above code, after creating several nodes and edges, i need to sort the edges of this graph based on their weight. I am studying a way to implement Kruskal algorithm so i though of sorting the edges first based on their weight. 
obviously does not work! since the vector edges_List is of type ""Edge"". 
Assuming that (myGraph is an object of the class).
I was wondering if there is any good technique to do that? 
Thanks in advance for your help! Any suggestions or ideas are greatly appreciated!

5907478,Merging two arrays of a class,"
I have two arrays of class Record.  Class Record is defined like this 
And these are the two arrays defined (already initialized)
the purpose is to find strings that match between the two arrays and add them to a new array where their counts are added together, and if there is a string not in the other array then just add to the new array.  To do this I have tried sorting the two arrays first, (in alphabetical order by strings), then comparing recordarray2, if the string matches then advance recordarray2's index otherwise advance recordarray1's index until you find one.  If you don't find it, then add it to the new array.
Unfortunately this method is WAY too slow, sorting itself takes 20+ seconds with STL sort. Is there a quicker standard method of sorting that i'm missing?

I'm using leveldb to store records (key-value), where the key is a 64-bit hash and the value is a double.

However, the database cannot fit into memory so I have to use some other method for sorting it in order to sort by account balance.
I'm considering using STXXL, but it requires that I make a copy of the database into a single flat file, then I can use STXXL to do an external sort (which would make a bunch of smaller files, sort them and then merge them back into another single flat file).

8014410,Algorithm for sorting a two-dimensional array based on similarities of adjecent objects,"
I'm writing a program that is supposed
to sort a number of square tiles (of which
each side is colored in one of five colors—red, orange,
blue, green and yellow), that are laying next to each other
(eg 8 rows and 12 columns) in a way that as many sides with
the same color connect as possible.
So, for instance, a tile with right side colored
red should have a tile on the right that has a red left-side.)
The result is evaluated by counting how many non-matching pairs
of sides exist on the board. I'm pretty much done with the actual program;
I just have some trouble with my sorting algorithm. Right now I'm using
Bubble-sort based algorithm, that compares every piece on the board
with every other piece, and if switching those two reduces the amount of
non-matching pairs of sides on the board, it switches them. Here a
abstracted version of the sorting function, as it is now:
As an explanation: Board is a pointer to an array of Piece Object. Each Piece has
four Piece-pointers that point to the four adjacent pieces (or NULL, if the Piece is
a side/corner piece.) And switching actually doesn't switch the pieces itself, but
rather switches the colors. (Instead of exchanging the pieces it scrapes off the color
of both and switches that.)
This algorithm doesn't work too bad, it significantly improves the value of the
board, but it doesn't optimize it as it should. I assume it's because side and corner
pieces can't have move than three/two wrong adjacent pieces, since one/two side(s)
are empty. I tried to compensate for that (by multiplying Board[i].GetMatchingPieces()
with Board[i].GetHowManyNonemptySides() before comparing), but that didn't help a bit.
And that's where I need help. I don't know very many sorting algorithms, let alone
those that work with two-dimensional arrays. So can anyone of you know about
an algorithmic concept that might help me to improve my work? Or can anyone see a
problem that I haven't found yet? Any help is appreciated. Thank you.

So obviously the distribution of the data will effect the speed of the sort.  My guess would be that since a comparison can just as quickly compare any two values, no matter their spread, the range of data values does not matter.
More importantly one should consider the lateral distribution (x direction ) with respect to ordering (magnitude removed).
A good test case to consider would be if the test data had some level of sorting...

First question here, and yes this is a homework question. We are tasked with performing merge sort on an array (which I am familiar with), but in a way I am unsure of how to do. Usually I would have a separate merge and merge sort function, and use the two. However, it sounds like he wants everything in one method? I was just hoping maybe someone could help clear things up for me, or put them into terms I can better understand.
From the assignment: 

you will need to implement a non-recursive version of merge-sort
  algorithm. Arrange two nested loops to accomplish this task. The outer
  loop should provide the size of segments for merging. The inner loop
  should take care of selecting positions of segments. The inner loop
  should start at the left edge and move your segments to the right.
  Arrange appropriate values of variables left, middle, right, so that
  sorting is accomplished just by iterating the call
  merge(a,left,middle,right).

I hate to be so vague, but I really don't understand any of what he's saying. First, what is meant by ""outer loop should provide the size of segments""? How does a loop provide anything? What about the next sentence - what does he mean by segments? The data?

8687387,Bug in my 'next offset' algorithm - C++,"
I am trying to apply filenames to the files loaded from an archive. 
For the first step, I create an array of structs that hold three bits of information. The filename, the file size and the offset in the file (from the beginning). The file sizes and offsets are initially read in to the structs. Then, I decode the filenames and read them into a vector.
Here is where it gets tricky. The filenames in order apply to the order of the offsets. The offsets however are not in order. For example:
So with 3 filenames decoded into my vector, I would apply filename #1 to file 1, filename #2 to file 3 (because it has a lower offset), and finally filename #3 to file 2.
Now, my algorithm for doing this doesn't seem to work correctly. Here is the code:
file_names is my vector with the strings in it. file_count is subtracted by 1 because it includes the directory file for the archive which does not need to be counted. It is also the highest offset and therefore not even dealt with.
Basically, this code tries to find the next highest offset every time and then apply the next file name in the vector.
Here is the output from my error log:
This indicates it has clearly not worked.
The other option I can do is sort the array of structs by offsets ascending, which I have no clue how to do but would make this process much easier as I could just apply the names in order.
Thank you for your time and let me know if you see the error.

suppose these machines used the Merge Sort.
Now say, i had 2000 machines each sorted 2000, 512 megs of chunk. Now when i merge them back, how does that work? Won't the size keep on increasing again? For example merging two 512 megs will make 1024Megs which is size of my RAM so how would this work? Any machine can't merge a chunk of more than 512 megs chunk with another chunk because then size > 1 GB.
How at the end of merging will i ever be able to merge two 0.5 TB chunk with another 0.5 TB chunk.. Does the concept of Virtual Memory come into play here?
I am here to clarify my basics and i hope i am asking this very important question (correctly) correctly. Also, who should do this merge(after sorting)? My machine or few of those 2000 machines?

8191014,Finding the range of smallest elements,"
Basically a follow-up question to my old question here: Choosing specific objects satisfying conditions
I have objects called variables that can either be assigned or unassigned. Every variable has a domain, which means the values a variable can be assigned to. For example a variable might take on values from 1 to 32. I can query the size of a variable in constant time with a very highly-optimized method.
One important operation is to somehow find the range of unassigned elements with the smallest domain sizes. For this I have a vector of pointers to all variable-objects. Bookkeeping is done in order to maintain an invariant which says that pointers to all unassigned variables occur first before all assigned ones.
As time steps go by, the variables change in a dynamic way that their domain sizes change and unassigned variables might become assigned and vice versa. When the states of the variables change, they are swapped so that invariant once again holds. This means that the size of the vector stays the same throughout the execution of the program.
Then comes my question: finding efficiently the range of unassigned variables that have the smallest domain size. What I am doing now: maintain the invariant with the vector of pointers. Then, when I need to find the range of elements, I fully sort the part of the vector containing pointers to the unassigned variables.
This is incredibly slow. According to the Visual Studio profiler I am using around 50% of total time sorting. These ranges of pointer elements I am sorting are quite small, at most 500-600 hundred elements. Is there a possible reason for this? 
Actually before this scheme, I was using a method that did not rely on sorting. It felt it should be slower and even asymptotically it was. I am seeing very big negative impacts in performance with my new scheme, and sorting is the one doing the biggest amount of work. 
Is there anything I could try? Sorting 500-600 elements should be nothing on modern hardware, right (and with std::sort)? std::partial_sort doesn't really change the situation either.
I am a bit unsure if I could provide you with any more useful info, but please let me know if there is something. I am really stunned by this phenomenon, whatever is causing it. I am using C++ if that matters, but this could be seen as language-independent question as well I suppose.
EDIT: Here's a simplified example:
A zero in this vector designates assigned variables, non-zero elements mean unassigned variables with that domain size. Let's say my vector looks like this:
Then my algorithm takes one step and changes the states of the variables. The vector then looks like
Right now the invariant is violated: there are unassigned variables in the front. I need to do something to correct this. Then I need to find the range of elements with the smallest values. Fixing and sorting produces for example then:
EDIT2:
Additional details about the problem. There are not many potential different value ranges for the unassigned variables. I do know it in advance and the maximum value is always at most 32, with 1 always being the lowest value. The changes to the values might occur anywhere in the set of elements, but when it happens, on one step each changing value changes by at most 1. And yes, I need to find all the elements with the lowest value.
Yes, I believe the reordering can be performed when the bookkeeping is performed. We can assume that we are starting with a sorted range and the invariant holds. But then comes the question, how does one actually go about doing the reordering? OK, probably I should check which elements have changed, and somehow let them float into their right places. Any ideas how to do this (on code level)? Is the data structure itself a good idea in the first place?
The first EDIT was a bit misleading, it is now corrected. So the ranges are always at most 500-600 elements, with many concecutive values in a small range (at most 1 to 32).
EDIT3:
If anyone is curious, I'll explain the previous approach that was much faster and did not rely on sorting. I believe all this can be done even more efficiently, so that's why I wanted to try changing to another scheme.
The idea was as follows: at every point, I would have a vector of pointers that contains only the elements with the smallest domain value. Then the algorithm does its work and something happens to the variables. First, I do a linear scan through all variables and check to see if the smallest domain value has changed. If it has, I rebuild the vector of elements. If it has not, I check the small range of pointers and either add or remove elements to make the invariant hold again (the container holds all the unassigned variables with the smallest domain).
I have a gut feeling this could be faster with my new scheme, since the size of the vector stays constant, elements are only swapped or rotated in it. I might be totally wrong though, it's very hard to say what really is efficient for the hardware.

Is it possible in C++ to ""lock"" these two vectors together and sort them in increasing order of mass? 
Thus after the sorting the vector mass should be in increasing order, and the velocity vector should contain the corresponding velocities of the sorted masses
e.g. Before sorting mass = (4,2,1,3) and velocity = (13, 14,15,16 )
     After sorting mass=(1,2,3,4) and velocity =(15, 14, 16, 13)
The one (non-efficient) way I know for this is to transfer the data into an vector of struct's

9753663,Designing an object in C++ that can be compared in multiple ways,"
Suppose we have an object which represent a box.
Now lets say in another class, in another file, we have an std::list<Box> that contains n boxes. We want to display a print out of these boxes in different ways. 

First we want to print them out in order of increasing size by their lengths. 
Then we want to print them out in order of increasing size by their widths. 
We don't care about their heights right now, but maybe later we will.

Now std::list has a member function sort() that takes a comparison function as an argument. How can we alter the above Box class so that we can call sort() on our list with different comparison functions? 
More specifically, can we define three different functions inside the box class and simply pass them to list.sort()? Is it better to define the comparison functions globally outside of the class Intuitively, tying them to the class seems better but why would this not be the case? Overall, what is the ""best"" way to achieve this?

What is the easiest way to do this?
Elaborating on ""natural"" we assume for a string made up from parts of numbers (N) and text (T) such that ...(N)(T)... , then for ...(N1)(T1)... and  ...(N2)(T2)... will be (N1<N2) (<) (T1<T2) where  (<) implies left term precedence over right term. In this case, numbers take precedence over text fields if they are in the same position in the string, i.e. 1.z (<) 1_t.txt .

9640204,What's a clean way to sort these separate-but-related sequences in C++?,"
I have two vector objects that contain different types of data that are ordered in the same way. My situation looks something like this:
For each Info entry in vec1, vec2 contains a sequence of double values, equal in length to the value of data_len in the corresponding element in vec1. For example:
I understand that this arrangement is not very OO and there is probably a ""more C++"" way to do this. However, other constraints in my environment force me toward this type of data packing, so I need to work around it. Unfortunately, the length of each data record in vec2 (specified by its data_len counterpart in vec1) are not known until runtime, and the length varies from record to record.
My problem: I would like to sort the two vectors by some criteria. Sorting vec1 is simple, as I can just use std::sort. At the same time, however, I need to sort vec2 such that the ordering described above is still maintained (i.e. the first block of values in vec2 corresponds to vec1[0] after it is sorted). It would be nice if I could get some kind of ""index vector"" out of the sorting process that I could then use to reorder vec2 (in-place or out-of-place operation would be fine), but I'm not sure of a good way to do that with the standard library (if there is one).
I could do the sort by defining a second intermediate structure that bundles the two together:
I would then populate vec3 appropriately based on the contents of vec1 and vec2, sort it, then fan the data back out to separate vectors again. However, this doesn't seem particularly efficient. Any suggestions on a better way to execute this?

Can someone explain me this way?

More text (to understand the context):
The algorithms sort, stable_sort, partial_sort, and nth_element require random access iterators, so they may be applied only to vectors, strings, deques, and arrays. It makes no sense to sort elements in standard associative containers, because such containers use their comparison functions to remain sorted at all times. The only container where we might like to use sort, stable_sort, partial_sort, or nth_element, but can't, is list, and list compensates somewhat by offering its sort member function. (Interestingly, list::sort performs a stable sort.) If you want to sort a list, then, you can, but if you want to use partial_sort, or nth_element on the objects in a list, you have to do it indirectly. One indirect approach is to copy the elements into a container with random access iterators, then apply the desired algorithm to that. Another is to create a container of list::iterators, use the algorithm on that container, then access the list elements via the iterators. A third is to use the information in an ordered container of iterators to iteratively splice the list's elements into the positions you'd like them to be in. As you can see, there are lots of options.

So, that the last character of any string should match with the first character of any other string and the last character of this string should be matched with the first character of any other string and this way i have to create a longest possible string.
For eg if i have a string vector like ""ABCD"" ""TGHI"" ""DADC"" ""IYUR"" ""CXYT""
so it would be arrange like ""ABCD""then there would be the third string""DADC"" then there would be the fifth string""CXYT"" and so on
So, the result will be ""ABCD""""DADC""""CXYT""""TGHI""""IYUR"".
Now,i was wondering if it would be a good idea to check each string with other string if it is 'compatible' according to the above rules.. so if i have 5 strings in the vector then i would have 5+4+3+2+1 possiblties and if for eg i have 20 strings then it would increase alot, so is this a good idea or is there any other good efficient solution to this...

I'm in my first year and second term of IT: programmer analyst and I am having some trouble with my code to come up with a lottery app.
All I have to do is output 3 rows of 7 numbers for the lotto max in random between 1-49, and then out put 6 numbers for the ""tag"", I'm having no trouble with the ""tag"" part because with tag you don't need to have the numbers in order and you can have 0's and also you can have duplicates of the numbers.

I have a collection of about a hundred or so sorted vector<int>'s   Although most vectors have a small number of integers in them, some of the vectors contain a large (>10K) of them (thus the vectors don't necessarily have the same size). 
What I'd like to do essentially iterate through smallest to largest integer, that are contained in all these sorted vectors.
One way to do it would be to merge all these sorted vectors into a sorted vector & simply iterate. Thus,
Question 1: What is the fastest way to merge sorted vectors into a sorted vector?
I'm sure on the other hand there are faster / clever ways to accomplish this without merging & re-sorting the whole thing -- perhaps popping the smallest integer iteratively from this collection of sorted vectors; without merging them first.. so:
Question 2: What is the fasted / best way to pop the least element from a bunch of sorted vector<int>'s?

Based on replies below,  and the comments to the question I've implemented an approach where I make a priority queue of iterators for the sorted vectors.  I'm not sure if this is performance-efficient, but it seems to be very memory-efficient.  I consider the question still open, since I'm not sure we've established the fastest way yet.

10587250,Fast to compile efficient sort algorithm (for JIT compilation),"
I am building a compiler which produces c++ code into a character array which is translated by JIT-compiler Clang to LLVM-IR and then further JIT-translated to executable code (which is than executed).
I am processing large amounts of data and at one point, i need to sort an array of a custom data type. The data type is dynamically build by my compiler and different for every JIT compilation. Usually the elements are lexicographically compared by some numbers in it, however, the comparision might be more complex in rare cases (following some pointers and fancy string compares).
Now my question:
What is an efficient sort algorithm which can by JIT compiled by llvm very fast and on the same time is very fast at the execution?
Are there somewhere algorithms around which can be compiled fast and run fast at the same time?
My first idea was to just JIT-ing a comparision function and give it to qsort() as a pointer (i can link to external compiled functions in LLVM).
However, qsort is shockingly inefficient at execution time.
The alternative, using std::sort is shockingly inefficient during compile time due to its templates and stl-blubbla-sugar.
I did some performance test for execution for the following struct:
1MB data runtimes:

std::sort: 5 ms
qsort: 14 ms
self-written: 6 ms

1GB data runtimes:

std::sort: 8.9 s
qsort: 24 s
self-written: 10.1 s

Unfortunately i do not have JIT compile times right now, but will post them in the future.
Currently it seems that my self written sort is better than qsort or std::sort, but i would rather like to use some library implementation.
Do you have any proposals on existing sort implementations which would be both fast in execution and for compilation?
Or are there maybe any other possibilities to speed up compiliation while having a fast sorting (only compile comparision function or something like that)?
By the way, here is my self-written (stolen from http://alienryderflex.com/quicksort/) sort routine (for JITing, i would not use a template Type but replacing it directly with the custom type, including ""<=""):

retrieve pair X: this should return the pair Y where Y's start < X's start < X's end < Y's end. If Y doesn't exist, return false. 

The basic solution is to simply keep a set of pairs. For retrieval, we'll iterate sequentially through the set to check. This is O(n). 
I'm looking for a better solution. I currently see 2 candidate data structures: 

Sorted vector
STL's set (internally implemented as binary search tree?)

Sorted Vector: 
Pros: can customize the binary search to support the retrieval operation. This is O(logn)
Cons: how to efficiently insert a new pair to maintain the sorted order. How to avoid a re-sorting cost of O(nlogn)?
Set: 
Pros: Easy insertion using the standard insert method. This is O(1)? 
Cons: How to avoid the sequential search? How to do better than O(n)?

I am looking for a suitable algorithm to build a relatively small (up to 255 elements) sorted array of integers. The target platform is a STM32 based embedded system. Since memory is limited, an in-place method is preferred.
I am aware that the obvious way is implement and profile the usual suspects (quick sort, insert sert, shell sort), but would like to ask for your experiences nevertheless. More specifically I have found very little information on the performance when building the array - that is, how well different algorithms may use the fact that all existing elements are already ordered.
Edit 1: 
Although the question is tagged C++ the STL is not available. Furthermore, the sorting does indeed occur inside a inner loop. To further clarify, I am looking for an algorithm that is especially suited to build a sorted list in an efficient manner. I assume (maybe wrongly) there must be algorithms specially suited for this task. That's the question. 
Edit 2:
When saying building a sorted list I mean that the list starts empty and is filled by by a bounded number (max 255) of 16-bit integers which are in no particular order. The list must be processed after all elements have been stored. For processing the list must be sorted, preferably in descending order.

9846681,Is there a sorting routine faster than qsort?,"
This is not an algorithmic question, but an implementation question.
I have a data structure that looks like:
I go through an array of about 40 million elements, and assign the 'val' fields to be the element, and the 'idx' field to be the index.
I'm then calling: 
and then, once I fill in val2, reversing the procedure with
where
and 
This setup takes 4 seconds to perform both sorts.  4 seconds seems like a long time for a sort of 40 million elements to take on a 3Ghz i5 processor; is there a faster approach?  I'm using vs2010 with the Intel Compiler (that has sorts, but not over structs like this that I can see).
Update:  Using std::sort shaves about 0.4 seconds off of the runtime, called like:
and
adding the 'inline' keyword to the predicates does not seem to matter.  Since i have, and the spec allows for, a quad core machine, I'll check some kind of multithreaded sort next.
Update 2: Following @SirGeorge and @stark, I took a look at a single sort done via pointer redirects:
Even though there is just a single sorting call (to the GradientOrdering routine), the resulting algorithm takes 5 seconds, 1 second longer than the qsort approach.  It looks like std::sort is winning for now.
Update 3:  Looks like Intel's tbb::parallel_sort is the winner, taking the runtime of a single sort down to 0.5s on my system (so, 1.0s for both, which means that it's scaling pretty well from the original 4.0s for both).  I tried to go with a parallel fanciness proposed by Microsoft here, but since I'm already using tbb and the syntax for parallel_sort is identical to the syntax for std::sort, I could use my earlier std::sort comparators to get everything finished.
I also used @gbulmer's suggestion (really, hitting-me-over-the-head realization) that I already have the original indeces, so instead of doing a second sort, I just need to assign a second array with the indeces from the first back into sorted order.  I can get away with this memory usage because I'm only deploying on 64bit machines with at least 4 gb of RAM (good to have these specs worked out ahead of time); without that knowledge, a second sort would be necessary.
@gbulmer's suggestion gives the most speedup, but the original question asked about fastest sort.  std::sort is the fastest single-threaded, parallel_sort is the fastest multithreaded, but no one gave that answer, so I'm giving @gbulmer the check.

11887668,Sorting until we have the lowest half of the sorted array,"
I am currently trying to get the values that are in the lowest half of an array of data. This array in unsorted at first.
From this:
To this :
An easy solution would be to sort the array (using quicksort) and then use only the values stored in the first half of the sorted array.
However, since quicksort and most efficient sorting algorithms will sort the entire array while I only need the first 50%, this seems like a waste of ressources. Note that performance is an issue in this project.
Knowing that a full sort is O(n log n) and that a sort that stops after it finds the lowest element is O(n), I can easily build a simple algorithm that will have a complexity of n/2 * n to find the lowest 50%. But is that really better than a full quicksort?
To be clear, what would be the best sort to use if we want only the lowest half of the values in an array?
If the 50% was smaller (like 1%), a sequential search of the lowest elements would of course be the fastest solution, but at what % does it become slower than a quicksort?
I am coding in C++ and using vectors, but this question should be pretty general.

11641605,Is it safe to sort a container which may contain infinities using quicksort?,"
I have realized that in order for quicksort to work, all the infinities need to be equal.
In other words, such a criterium is not enough:
This sorting fails, because not all infinities are equal according to the criterium. The unequalness depends on the order in which the entities enter the operator. I found out, that such a ordering fails.
I need something like this:
But suppose that instead of 
methods, I would like to use just 
And have it return 
in cases where 
would return true. 
Now I tested this approach and it seems to work. But I am concerned about other ways in which an infinity may arise. For example:
This infinity seems to be the same. But I want to be sure. I know that C++ standard does not mention details of floating point arithmetic implementation, but if I use gcc, is it safe in all cases? I mean are all infinities created equal in gcc? Is it safe to sort a container of floats, which may contain infinities which have arisen on different occasions?

there is a valid operator [] available to access the elements of the collection
the elements of the collection support the ""less than"" comparable concept.

To get ideas I went to the header file <std_algo.h> and found the function interface below which matches exactly what I'm looking for except one detail, I don't see how looping through the underlying _RandomAccessIterator will be auto-vectorized by the compiler disregard of the container type and this is my question ... is there a way I can have it all? auto-vectorization + generic interface disregard of the underlying collection type? 
I think the code below won't auto-vectorize due to the ""non-canonical"" loop pattern while (__last - __first > int(_S_threshold)) and conditions like if (__depth_limit == 0) but this last I won't need in my algorithm. So I see the auto-vectorization would be prevented by the non-canonical type of loop.

11562124,Sort objects of dynamic size,"
Problem
Suppose I have a large array of bytes (think up to 4GB) containing some data. These bytes correspond to distinct objects in such a way that every s bytes (think s up to 32) will constitute a single object. One important fact is that this size s is the same for all objects, not stored within the objects themselves, and not known at compile time.
At the moment, these objects are logical entities only, not objects in the programming language. I have a comparison on these objects which consists of a lexicographical comparison of most of the object data, with a bit of different functionality to break ties using the remaining data. Now I want to sort these objects efficiently (this is really going to be a bottleneck of the application).
Ideas so far
I've thought of several possible ways to achieve this, but each of them appears to have some rather unfortunate consequences. You don't necessarily have to read all of these. I tried to print the central question of each approach in bold. If you are going to suggest one of these approaches, then your answer should respond to the related questions as well.
1. C quicksort
Of course the C quicksort algorithm is available in C++ applications as well. Its signature matches my requirements almost perfectly. But the fact that using that function will prohibit inlining of the comparison function will mean that every comparison carries a function invocation overhead. I had hoped for a way to avoid that. Any experience about how C qsort_r compares to STL in terms of performance would be very welcome.
2. Indirection using Objects pointing at data
It would be easy to write a bunch of objects holding pointers to their respective data. Then one could sort those. There are two aspects to consider here. On the one hand, just moving around pointers instead of all the data would mean less memory operations. On the other hand, not moving the objects would probably break memory locality and thus cache performance. Chances that the deeper levels of quicksort recursion could actually access all their data from a few cache pages would vanish almost completely. Instead, each cached memory page would yield only very few usable data items before being replaced. If anyone could provide some experience about the tradeoff between copying and memory locality I'd be very glad.
3. Custom iterator, reference and value objects
I wrote a class which serves as an iterator over the memory range. Dereferencing this iterator yields not a reference but a newly constructed object to hold the pointer to the data and the size s which is given at construction of the iterator. So these objects can be compared, and I even have an implementation of std::swap for these. Unfortunately, it appears that std::swap isn't enough for std::sort. In some parts of the process, my gcc implementation uses insertion sort (as implemented in __insertion_sort in file stl_alog.h) which moves a value out of the sequence, moves a number items by one step, and then moves the first value back into the sequence at the appropriate position:
Do you know of a standard sorting implementation which doesn't require a value type but can operate with swaps alone?
So I'd not only need my class which serves as a reference, but I would also need a class to hold a temporary value. And as the size of my objects is dynamic, I'd have to allocate that on the heap, which means memory allocations at the very leafs of the recusrion tree. Perhaps one alternative would be a vaue type with a static size that should be large enough to hold objects of the sizes I currently intend to support. But that would mean that there would be even more hackery in the relation between the reference_type and the value_type of the iterator class. And it would mean I would have to update that size for my application to one day support larger objects. Ugly.
If you can think of a clean way to get the above code to manipulate my data without having to allocate memory dynamically, that would be a great solution. I'm using C++11 features already, so using move semantics or similar won't be a problem.
4. Custom sorting
I even considered reimplementing all of quicksort. Perhaps I could make use of the fact that my comparison is mostly a lexicographical compare, i.e. I could sort sequences by first byte and only switch to the next byte when the firt byte is the same for all elements. I haven't worked out the details on this yet, but if anyone can suggest a reference, an implementation or even a canonical name to be used as a keyword for such a byte-wise lexicographical sorting, I'd be very happy. I'm still not convinced that with reasonable effort on my part I could beat the performance of the STL template implementation.
5. Completely different algorithm
I know there are many many kinds of sorting algorithms out there. Some of them might be better suited to my problem. Radix sort comes to my mind first, but I haven't really thought this through yet. If you can suggest a sorting algorithm more suited to my problem, please do so. Preferrably with implementation, but even without.
Question
So basically my question is this:
“How would you efficiently sort objects of dynamic size in heap memory?”
Any answer to this question which is applicable to my situation is good, no matter whether it is related to my own ideas or not. Answers to the individual questions marked in bold, or any other insight which might help me decide between my alternatives, would be useful as well, particularly if no definite answer to a single approach turns up.

In one of my reports/display functions, I must print out the rooms in an order of Floor numbers, first, then by the Room numbers. What I mean by this is there will be multiple rooms on each floor so if you were sorting all the rooms on floor 1, it will sort the rooms in ascending order before it goes to the next floor. 
Now, I understand how to sort the rooms by Floor number, and I know how to sort by Room number. What I don't understand is how do I combine it so that one does not over write the order of the other.
Thanks in advance.

11380080,std::vector of objects and sorting results in segmentation faults,"
I been sitting over this problem quiet a few hours now and can not find a solution. I try to get rid of some Custom Array classes and want to change them to std::vector.
I have a class member declared like this:
In the class constructor I do not initialize the vector to a certain size. I leave it as is, uninitialized. Before, I tried to initialize if to a certain size (to gain some performance and prevent many reallocations), but that gave me problems accessing the elements in a loop (eg. printing them out). I guess it is due to the initialization of the objects with the default constructor (of type BaseCluster) as NULL-Objects ??
However, in a loop I fill the vector with objects like this 
After the loop finishes I do some cleanup of objects that are not interesting:
Now I sort the vector (should be sorted by score descending) and here I have a problem:
1.) using the sort as
doesn't sort at all, also my implemented ""operators<"" or ""operator>"" in the BaseCluster class are not touched at all. The operators are public and look like this.
2.) Using a predicate / functor
the class member getScore looks like this
and executing the sort with
will result in an segmentation fault when trying to access the getScore() method after sorting about 60 - 70 objects.
I have the feeling that due to reserving / resizing of the vector there are NULL-objects (constructed with the default constructor of BaseClass ?!). 
And now am stuck on how to solve the problem. What am I doing wrong here? I been reading through many other related stackoverflow questions before asking here, followed them by changing here and there but no way out of the seg. faults. As far as I am aware I do not insert any Null-Objects (tested that in the loop), so there must be another flaw in my code. Thought it was an quiet easy task changing to a vector of pointers, but seems more complicated now...
Please, anybody help me on this issue. Thanks so much in advance!

11368735,C++ get files in directory by modify time,"
I would like to write a C++ function that fills a vector with the filename of all of the files in a directory.  Furthermore, I would like this vector to be ordered by the last modified time of the files.
I can use boost::filesystem to read in all of the files in the directory and pass it to a vector, but these get loaded to the vector by filename and then I have stat the file and perform a sort which is not very efficient.

11341498,order a vector of points based on another vector,"
I am working on a C++ application.
I have 2 vectors of points 
Point2f is defined typedef Point_<float> Point2f; 
vectorAll has 1000 point while vectorSpecial has 10 points.
First Step: 
I need to order the points in vectorSpecial depending on their order in vectorAll.
So something like this: 
I can do a double loop and save the indexes. and then order the points based on their indexes. However this method is taking too long when we have lots of points (for example 10000 points in vectorAll and 1000 points in vectorSpecial so that's ten million iteration)
What are better methods of doing that?
Second Step:
Some points in vectorSpecial might not be available in vectorAll. I need to take the point that is closest to it (by using the usual distance formula sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2))
This also can be done when looping, but if someone has any suggestions for better methods, I would appreciate it.

11085282,sort c++ vector using a lock and STL algo or write a more complex algo with no lock?,"
Is there an efficient way to compare two vectors doing STL type operations such that I don't have to sort them or copy them?  The problem is that sorting causes me to have to create a lock on the getIntersection method and ideally I would like to avoid this as it is really just reading the data structure and finding data inside of it and not altering it. The sort method alters the data structure so other calls of the method need to be synchronized.  I probably need to just create a copy but that might be a large copy but may be faster than locking but not sure. Therefore my question becomes whether searching the sorted vector is more efficient than just taking the price of the lock or a copy.  Consider the following example:

11016630,An efficient sorting algorithm for almost sorted list containing time data?,"
The name says it all really.  I suspect that insertion sort is best, since it's the best sort for mostly-sorted data in general.  However, since I know more about the data there is a chance there are other sorts woth looking at.  So the other relevant pieces of information are:
1) this is time data, which means I presumable could create an effective hash for ordering of data.
2) The data won't all exist at one time.  instead I'll be reading in records which may contain a single vector, or dozen or hundreds of vectors.  I want to output all time within a 5 second window.  So it's possible that a sort that does the sorting as I insert the data would be a better option.
3) memory is not a big issue, but CPU speed is as this may be a bottleneck of the system.
Given these conditions can anyone suggest an algorithm that may be worth considering in addition to insertion sort?  Also, How does one defined 'mostly sorted' to decide what is a good sort option?  What I mean by that is how do I look at my data and decided 'this isn't as sorted as I thought it as, maybe insertion sort is no longer the best option'?  Any link to an article which considered process complexity which better defines the complexity relative to the degree data is sorted would be appreciated.
Thanks

thank you everyone for your information.  I will be going with an easy insertion or merge sort (whichever I have already pre-written) for now.

Update: thank you Xeo, Rick and everyone who responded. As Xeo and Rick explained, the problem is that the comparator (in my case struct a with the map containing values) gets copied on each comparison, hence the computational complexity O(imax^2 log(imax)). One way around this that I can see (so that changes to my code are minimal) is to use a pointer to the map, namely map<a*,float>* vals, instead of map<a*,float> vals. Then the map copying is avoided, and the complexity is back to O(imax log(imax)). Thanks a lot!

I have an array of rows where the index represents the row which stores how many available seats are in that row. If I used the sort method then it will sort the available seats but I will lose which row it corresponds to. Obviously I can loop through it looking for the max amount of seat I want and if I don't find that, I can decrement my amount and so on but that is not optimal.

12431981,c++ vector sorting,"
This is a generic question about the mechanism behind sorting using the STL std::sort function. I've read some posts about sorting and that, in general, sorting vectors is faster than sorting linked lists. Is this true for vectors and linked lists of structures/objects? For a linked list of structures, I feel sorting can easily be achieved by just modifying the indexes. On the other hand, sorting for vectors seems like it would involve physically switching the data locations of the data of the structure/object since they are contiguous (is this true?). In that case it seems sorting linked lists would be faster.
EDIT!!!: Now with picture:

So I guess the question is better phrased: Which is faster for sorting objects, sorting a linked list OR a vector (although this might depend on the size of the object)? Also, is the sorting for a linked list done as shown in 3) and is the sorting done for a vector done as showing in 2)?

12259622,Why Bubble Sort needs nested loops?,"
I am going to start the new question. I posed the question yesterday and wanted to know what's the problem in my program. The program is given below and you people pointed out that this following program does only one pass of the sorting and needs an outer loop as well. At that time I was good like OK. But again when I looked the program I got confused and need to ask Why we need Outer loop as well for the sort since only a single loop can do the sorting(In my opinion). First see program below then I present my logic at the end of the program.
I think the ONLY loop with the bubble condition should do the sorting. Look at the following loop of the program:
Now I explain what I am thinking what this loop ""should"" do. It will first compare number[0] with number[1]. If the condition is satisfied it will do what is in IF statement's body. Then i will be incremented by 1(i++). Then on next iteration the values compared will be number[1] with number[2]. Then why it does not happen and the loop exits after only pass? In other words may be I'm trying to ask IF statement does not repeat itself in for loop? In my opinion it does. I'm very thankful for help and views, my question might be of small level but that is how I will progress.

I'm learning sorting algorithms and as next step, I'm trying to get my implementation perform close to the std::sort(). I'm pretty far, so far.. :-)

standard quicksort (using temp arrays).
quicksort with following optimizations:

median3 used to select median
tail-recursion
quicksort applied only upto partition sizes < 16. For smaller partitions insertion sort is used.
insertion sort applied to the whole array at once instead of applying to each partition, left unsorted by quicksort.

quicksort with all optimizations listed above + in-place partitioning (no temp arrays).

I expected the performance to be best bottom up, but it's best top down!
What's wrong with my implementation? Given the drastic difference between the performance I assume there is something outrightly wrong.

11985859,Sorting string vectors: plain C vs idiomatic C++11,"
I am currently trying to learn C++11 and its fancy features. To be specific I am searching for high efficiency genericity. So I happily wrote a program in C++11 to sort lines of an input file to test my fresh skills. Because of inlining and nice features of C++ compilers I expected high performance on this small example. To get a hint at how fast was my program I hacked exactly the same program in C using the qsort function, since it is raw C no inlining is performed on this function and my comparison function is called with an indirection and needs to do two indirections to access char * pointers representing strings.
The facts
Yet, I was very surprised by the results, C seems 4 times faster than C++. On a 8Mb file, I get the following results:
Note that I tried to be as fair as possible, compilation options are the same and my C program (dumped later) behave the same way as the C++ one: no limit on the size of the input lines and no limit on the number of input lines.
I also noticed that while my C program calls malloc almost once for each input line, the C++ program has a ratio of 10 allocations per input line!
The code
Here are the two programs I used to make my comparison.
And my much more verbose C version.
Question
Could someone tell me where my C++ program must be changed (without becoming plain C) to be faster? I tried to stay very idiomatic, is it a good way to hack in C++ or should I tend to write C-like code when I want high performance? Why is the C++ program allocating that much on the heap, how can I reduce this?

I have two different implementations of quicksort below. I have verified that oth of these versions of quicksort work in the sense that they will sort any array I give it correctly. If you notice (at least it appears to me), Version #2 is exactly the same as Version #1 when the array size n is greater than 8. Therefore, I would expect that when I give both of these functions an array of the same size that is greater than 8, they should make around the same number of component wise comparisons on average, but they do not. 
For n > 8, both functions use sort3() and partition() functions. I have listed those below as well to show you how I count the number of component wise comparisons.
I know that W(n), the theoretical worst case number of comparisons for these implementations of quicksort is (n(n+2)/4)+8. Therefore, for an array size n = 500, W(n) = 62758. For a test run on an array of size n = 500, Version #1 makes about 5000 comparisons on average which is reasonable. However, Version #2 is making 80000 comparisons on average. Obviously this can't be right - Version #2 is making more comparisons than the theoretical W(n) and it is exactly (at least appears to me) the same algorithm as Version #1. 
Do you see an error that I am making in Version #2?

I'm trying to figure out how to sort a deque of structs on two values, not just one.  The code I have is what I have which perfectly sorts on arrival, but if two items came in with the same pid, I'd like them to be in pid order as well.  I hope I'm making sense!
For example:
A process that has a pid of 1 and an arrival of 10 should be before a process with pid of 2 with an arrival of 10, even if the process with pid 1 comes later in the deque originally.

13323711,An fast algorithm for sorting and shuffling equal valued entries (preferably by STL's),"
I'm currently developing stochastic optimization algorithms and have encountered the following issue (which I imagine appears also in other places): It could be called totally unstable partial sort:

Given a container of size n and a comparator, such that entries may be equally valued. 
  Return the best k entries, but if values are equal, it should be (nearly) equally probable to receive any of them. 

(output order is irrelevant to me, i.e. equal values completely among the best k need not be shuffled. To even have all equal values shuffled is however a related, interesting question and would suffice!)
A very (!) inefficient way would be to use shuffle_randomly and then partial_sort, but one actually only needs to shuffle the block of equally valued entries ""at the selection border"" (resp. all blocks of equally valued entries, both is much faster). Maybe that Observation is where to start...
I would very much prefer, if someone could provide a solution with STL algorithms (or at least to a large portion), both because they're usually very fast, well encapsulated and OMP-parallelized.
Thanx in advance for any ideas!

13229229,why is Insertion sort best case big O complexity O(n)?,"
Following is my insertion sort code:
The average complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2). 
From my understanding of big O notation, this is because we run two loops in this case(outer one n-1 times and inner one 1,2,...n-1 = n(n-1)/2 times and thus the resulting asymptomatic complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2).
Now I have read that best case is the case when the input array is already sorted.
And the big O complexity of the algorithm is O(n) in such a case. But I fail to understand how this is possible as in both cases (average and best case) we have to run the loops the same number of times and have to compare the elements. The only thing that is avoided is the  shifting of elements. 
So does complexity calculation also involve a component of this swapping operation?

All,
I have following task.
I have finite number of strings (categories). Then in each category there will be a set of team and the value pairs. The number of team is finite based on the user selection.
Both sizes are not more than 25.
Now the value will change based on the user input and when it change the team should be sorted based on the value.
I was hoping that STL has some kind of auto sorted vector or list container, but the only thing I could find is std::map<>.
So what I think I need is:
and just call std::sort() when the value will change.
Or is there more efficient way to do it?
[EDIT]
I guess I need to clarify what I mean.
Think about it this way.
You have a table. The rows of this table are teams. The columns of this table are categories. The cells of this table are divided in half. Top half is the category value for a given team. This value is increasing with every player.
Now when the player is added to a team, the scoring categories of the player will be added to a team and the data in the columns will be sorted. So, for category ""A"" it may be team1, team2; and for category ""B"" it may be team2, team1.
Then based on the position of each team the score will be assigned for each team/category.
And that score I will need to display.
I hope this will clarify what I am trying to achieve and it become more clear of what I'm looking for.

activeObjectCount tells me how many objects I am actually using, and activeObjectIndex tells me which objects I am using. If the 0th, 7th, and 10th objects were being used I would want activeObjectIndex = [0,7,10,-1,-1,-1,...,-1]; and activeObjectCount=3;
As different objects become active or inactive I would like activeObjectIndex list to remain ordered. 
Currently I am just sorting the activeObjectIndex at the end of each loop that the values might change in.
First, is there a better way to keep track of objects (that may or may not be active) in an embedded system than what I am doing?  If not, is there an algorithm I can use to keep the objects sorted each time I add or remove and active object? Or should I just periodically do a bubble sort or something to keep them in order?

I have 2 arrays where the ith element of first array corresponds to the ith element of other array. That is, if I move the ith element of first array to jth position than I have to do the same for second array.

14763962,Sorting a two-dimensional array of characters? C++,"
I'm trying to sort a 10X15 array of characters, where each row is a word.  My goal is to sort it in a descending order, from the largest value word at the top, at array[row 0][column 0 through 14] position, and the smallest value word at the bottom array[row 9][column 0 through 14]. Each row is a word (yeah, they don't look as words, but it's to test the sorting capability of the program).
To clarify:  What I need to do is this... considering that EACH row is a whole word, I need to sort the rows from the highest value word being at the top, and the lowest value word being at the bottom.
Edit:
Everything works now.  For anyone who has a similar question, look to the comments below, there are several fantastic solutions, I just went with the one where I create my own sort function to learn more about sorting.  And thanks to all of you for helping me! :)

[EDIT]
Here is what I am trying to do.
Let's say I have a football team. It has 10 players. For every player there are bunch of technical/tactical values that can be considered either during the training or during the game.
So, all this is stored like this:
Now initially when the game starts all those values are 0. Now when player 5 do pass forward the value of the score[""Player5Name] will become 1, but all other will stay 0.
At the end of the training those values will become sorted for each player and depending on whose player have bigger value the main scoring system will be updated.
So if player 5 has 100 passes forward and this value is the biggest one and nobody else has it than this player gets assigned the value of 10.
If players 3, 7 and 9 has 90 passes and it's second place then the calculation is (9+8+7)/3
And so forth.
The Foo class has another std::string member that describe what the player did so that the vector can be sorted by appropriate action.
I hope this clarifies what I am trying to do better.

14593791,GPU-accelerated sort (~1GB) and merge sort (~100GB),"
I'm asking for a c++ library to do GPU-accelerated sort (around 1GB of data) and merge sort (say, around 100GB of data — but the size do not matter, because merge is a stream algorithm). License have to be LGPL, BSD or like this. I greatly prefer OpenCL because of portability (but I also interested in links to CUDA libraries). I appreciate links to papers and blog posts on this subject.
 Some background (please correct me if I wrong): 
2-way merge sort of 1GB (that is, 128 000 000 of 8-bytes entities) will consume approximately log2(128 000 000)·1G = 27GB of memory bandwidth, that is around 1 second on modern CPU with sequential memory bandwidth of ~30GB/s. (Any non-merge sort seems to take much longer time, because non-sequential memory access is slower in 10-100 times).
Although I am not familiar with modern GPU, I suspect that merge sort of 1GB will take 0.2 second or even less, because typical GPU memory bandwidth is around 150GB/s, like AMD/ATI 58xx (see, for example http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_AMD_graphics_processing_units#Evergreen_.28HD_5xxx.29_series) 
That is at least 5x speedup. (The time to transfer 1GB over 16x PCI-E 2.0 is around 0.125s, but it seems possible to make PCI transfers in parallel with sorting; however, this may require 2GB or 3GB of video-card memory instead of 1GB).
I suspect even more speed-up due to more-than-2-way merge sort or some sort, suitable for GPU.

I was trying to create an implementation where the user could give as input the array itself and a string. An example of a string in the above example would be 03 which would mean that the user wants to sort the array based on the first and the fourth column.
So in this case the result of the sorting would be the following:
I didn't know a lot about the compare functions that are being used inside the STL's sort function, however after searching I created the following simple implementation:
I created a class called Comparator.h
I need to know the information inside the string so I need to have a class where this string is a private variable. Inside the operator I would have two parameters first and second, each of which will refer to a row. Now having this information I create a left and a right vector where in the left vector I have only the numbers of the first row that are important to the sorting and are specified by the string variable and in the right vector I have only the numbers of the second row that are important to the sorting and are specified by the string variable.
Then I do the needed comparisons and return true or false. The user can use this class by calling this function inside the Sorting.cpp class:
Here is an example use:
I have two questions:
First question
Can my implementation get better? I use extra variables like the left and right vectors, and then I have some for loops which brings some extra costing to the sorting operation.
Second question
Due to the extra cost, how much worse does the time complexity of the sorting become? I know that STL's sort is O(n*logn) where n is the number of integers that you want to sort. Here n has a different meaning, n is the number of rows and each row can have up to m integers which in turn can be found inside the Comparator class by overriding the operator function and using extra variables(the vectors) and for loops.
Because I'm not sure how exactly is STL's sort implemented I can only make some estimates.
   My initial estimate would be O(n*m*log(n)) where m is the number of columns that are important to the sorting however I'm not 100% certain about it.

I am trying to understand the quicksort mechanism but so far I can't figure it out. According to wikipedia, the steps are : 
1. Pick an element, called a pivot, from the list.
2. Reorder the list so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it (equal values can go either way). After this partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is called the partition operation.
3. Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-list of elements with smaller values and separately the sub-list of elements with greater values.
And this is the code:
All is somehow clear to me except one thing. Why is the partition function returning i and not j?

15317876,Optimization of a clockwise sort algorithm,"
So this is an optimization question, which I could not find answered.
I have written some code for computing the convex hull of a given set of random points. For comparative purposes, I have made my own, slow O(n³) algorithm, using some old OpenGL stuff to visualize it. Because of the nature of the slow convex hull algorithm, the points are not sorted at all. So the sort takes place just after the computation of the CH. 
My problem is that up till 1000 points, I have a visual result in less than a second. But for 10000 points, it takes over 15-20 minutes (I have not waited beyond that). However if I skip the sorting code and let opengl display the convex hull vertices unsorted, it takes less than a minute. So it's the ClockWise sorting that's eats up all that time. Check the code (some names don't make sense as they are defined elsewhere) :
// This code actually compares every pair iteratively with respect to the center point
// Consider a given vector ""convex"", which contains all the convex hull points unsorted

.
..
...
....

int avgx,avgy,sumx=0,sumy=0;

for (int i=0;i<convex.size();i++){
    sumx+=convex.at(i).at(0);
    sumy+=convex.at(i).at(1);
}

avgx=sumx/(convex.size()/2.0); //something like an internal point
avgy=sumy/(convex.size()/2.0);

sort(convex.begin(),convex.end()); //x-sort 
int det,tempx,tempy;
for (int i=0;i<convex.size()-1;i++){
    x1=convex.at(i).at(0);
    y1=convex.at(i).at(1);
    x2=convex.at(i+1).at(0);
    y2=convex.at(i+1).at(1);
    det=(x1-avgx)*(y2-avgy)-(x2-avgx)*(y1-avgy); 
    if (det<0){ //on which side of O-X1 lies X2?
        tempx=convex.at(i).at(0); //swapping points 
        tempy=convex.at(i).at(1);
        convex.at(i).at(0)=convex.at(i+1).at(0);
        convex.at(i).at(1)=convex.at(i+1).at(1);
        convex.at(i+1).at(0)=tempx;
        convex.at(i+1).at(1)=tempy;
        i=-1; //check again the new vector from the beginning
    }
    }
return convex;

The display part:
glColor3f(0.8, 0.2, 0.2);
glPointSize(3);
glBegin(GL_LINE_LOOP);
    for (int i=0;i<count;i++){
        glVertex2f(convexHull.at(i).at(0),convexHull.at(i).at(1));
    }
glEnd();

From what I've seen, this approach (by comparing cross products) is the most efficient. However, before this I wrote some filthy code which actually was faster, as it gave me a visual result within 8 minutes. I don't want to keep that because it's too dirty and long, this one is cleaner but very slow (if it actually works at all....). So, am I bound to wait so much for a CW sort of 10000 convex points, or there is something I am missing?  
I'd appreciate any thoughts, let me know if I need to include anything else.

So it sorts based on the first column, then the 4th column. I'm not sure how to sort something, then only sort the conflicting elements using the next argument without resorting the entire column. I'm currently storing the input in a vector of vectors.

I wrote a program to do an external mergesort on a file of 100,000 doubles. I couldn't quickly find and external storage libraries for c++ because googling it just leads to a bunch of pages about the extern keyword, so I decided to just write my own, and I think that's where the problem is.
The program actually works, except for a couples details. The output fill will have all of the doubles in sorted order, but at the end of the file are 30 lines of 
which is not in the input file. I also have 21 more values in the output file and the input file, not counting the 30 lines of the single number I just mentioned.
How the program runs is it reads the 100,000 doubles ~4000 lines at a time and sorts them, then stores them in to 26 text files, then those 26 files are merged into 13 files, and those 13 into 7, etc... until there is only one file.
I'm sorry if the code is really ugly, I figured out all of the external storage stuff on my own by pencil, paper, trial, and error. The program is  not going to be used for anything. I haven't cleaned it up yet. The driver doesn't do much other than call these methods. 
//reads an ifstream file and stores the data in a deque. returns a bool indicating if the file has not reached EOF
//opens a file with the specified filename and prints the contents of the deque to it. if append is true, the data will be appended to the file, else it will be overwritten
//merges the sortfiles until there is one file left
//merge function
I sorted a file of 26 numbers (0 - 25), as ThePosey suggested, and here are the results:
So I'm pretty sure the last number of the file is being duplicated, but I'm still not sure what the 47 occurrences of the random large number is caused by. I checked and the last number of the 100,000 number word is only in the output file twice, not 22 times, So I think I have 11 separate last number being duplicated.

insert:- inserts element1(name1, priority1) to the container:
C.insert(element(name1, priority1))
update :- update priority of element with name=name1 as priorityNew1:
C[name1] = priorityNew1
delete:-deletes the element with name=name1: C.delete(name1)
get and remove element with highest priority: C.pop()
get element with highest priority: C.peek()

Basically I want a combination of map and heap. map on element's 'name', and heap on element's 'priority'.
Most ideally I would like every operation as O(1).
Otherwise insert, update, delete as O(log N) and pop and peek as O(1) is also fine.
I could think of following two approaches
1) Using a hash map of elements, hashed on name.
so insert update delete are O(1) 
pop and peek are O(N), we search whole container for highest priority.
2) Using SQLite with table 'element' having two columns 'name' and 'priority'.
running times will be based on SQLite implementations.

15105532,Making an efficient algorithm for sorting with a pointer,"
Consider a simple struct:
Now I have to sort a given linked list only using freeNode and the method has to be efficient. I can't make another list and use some kind of sorted-insert there. Nor can use genome or bubble sort. The pointer freeNode of any elem in the list can be pointing to any elem in the list.
Now I have come up with two ideas:

Use freeNode to make a doubly Linked List.
And do pair comparing, i.e. compare the ith elem with the (i+1)th elem. When I find that two elements need to be swapped, I swap them and then again start from the head of the List.
This algorithm would be more than O(n) (not sure just guessing). It will take much time.
Another method is that my freeNode points to elem that is smaller than it.
E.g. if I have 30->6->14->56>Tail, then
But again, this doesn't help much, because when I insert 45 or 20 I would have to re-arrange my freeNode pointer. And, again, it would not be a very efficient method.

Any suggestions on this? How to use freeNode to implement a better and efficient method for sorting. Pseudo-code would work, and I'd actually prefer that over real code.
EDIT: You can't use arrays, vectors or anything else. Just the freeNode pointer. Use it in any way you want. Keep it NULL or have it point to elements of your choice.

I'm working on an SDK which defines interfaces like
So basically, a foo is an opaque type that I can treat as a fixed-length binary buffer + and associated ordering function.
Now, I want to sort these foos before passing them back to client code. There may potentially be many foos, so I'll have to implement external sorting, but I'd like to use std::sort to sort the initial runs.
I was thinking I would allocate a buffer of size N * FooIter::GetFooSize(), fill it with foos using FooIter, and then sort it with std::sort before writing it to disk.
I can start by writing an iterator class
and a wrapper class for foo memory
My understanding is that std::sort will use std::swap to rearrange the elements in the sequence. My issue is I can't see how to specialize std::swap on FooWrapper to perform the swap efficiently (most importantly, no dynamic allocation). I could swap byte by byte, but that also seems inefficient.
Another way of doing this would be to sort a parallel sequence of pointers into my Foo array, but I don't want to do that, since in practice, the foos will likely be quite small, so the parallel sequence could use just as much memory as the foo sequence, and I want to maximize the number of them I can sort at a time.
There's also good ol' qsort which is probably more suited to this kind of thing, but I'm not sure how to convert the FooComparator object into a function pointer (there may be multiple implementations of FooComparator).
Or is there a better way of going about this? I don't really want to write my own sort implementation, although it probably wouldn't be too hard.

15925326,Sorting a std::vector which has parts of it sorted (formed by concatenation of sorted vectors),"
I have an std::vector as one of the inputs for an API i am exposing. 
I know that the user of this API can send a huge vector, but that vector was formed by concatenation of sorted vectors. This means that the vector that I get is formed from a number of sorted vectors.
I need to sort this vector. 
I would like to know which sorting algorithm is best suited. 
I would prefer an in-place sorting algo like merge or quick as I dont want to take up more memory (the vector is already a huge one).
Also would it be better to change the API interface to accept N sorted vectors and then do the N-way merging myself. I dont want to go with this unless the saving is really huge. 
Also while doing N-way merge I would want to do it in-place if possible. 
So ideally i would prefer the approach where i use some ready sort algorithm on the big vector (as that would be simpler I feel).

15914569,Is it possible to use CUDA in order to compute the frequency of elements inside a sorted array efficiently?,"
I'm very new to Cuda, I've read a few chapters from books and read a lot of tutorials online. I have made my own implementations on vector addition and multiplication.
I would like to move a little further, so let's say we want to implement a function that takes as an input a sorted array of integers.
Our goal is to find the frequencies of each integer that is in the array. 
Sequentially we could scan the array one time in order to produce the output. The time complexity would be O(n).
Since the groups are different, I guess it must be possible to take advantage of CUDA.
Suppose this is the array
In order to achieve full parallelism, each thread would have to know exactly which part of the array it has to scan in order to find the sum. This can only be achieved if we use another array called int dataPosPerThread[] which for each thread id the dataPosPerThread[threadId] would have as value the starting position on the initial array. So, that would mean that each thread would know where to start and where to finish.
However in this way we won't gain anything, because it would take us O(n) time in order to find the positions. Eventually the total cost would be O(n) + cost_to_transfer_the_data_to_the_gpu + O(c) + cost_to_transfer_the_results_to_the_gpu
where O(c) is the constant time it would take for the threads to find the final output, assuming of course that we have many different integers inside the initial array.
I would like to avoid the extra O(n) cost.
What I've thought so far is, having an array of size arraySize, we specify the total amount of threads that will be used, let's say totalAmountOfThreads which means that each thread will have to scan totalAmountOfThreads/arraySize values.
The first thread(id 0) would start scanning from position 0 until position totalAmountOfThreads/arraySize.
The second thread would start from totalAmountOfThreads/arraySize + 1 and so on.
The problem is though that some thread might be working with different integer groups or with one group that has more values being processed by other threads. For instance in the above example if we suppose that we will have 6 threads, each thread will take 2 integers of the array, so we will have something like this:
As you can see thread 0 has only 1 values, however there are other 1 values that are being processed by thread 2. In order to achieve parallelism though, these threads have to be working on unrelated data. Assuming that we will use this logic, each thread will compute the following results:
By having this result what can be further achieved? Someone could suggest using an extra hash_map, like unordered_map which can efficiently update for each value computed by a single thread the total variable. However

Unordered_map is not supported by cuda compiler
This would mean that the threads would not be able to take advantage of shared memory because two threads from different blocks could be working with the same values, so the hash map would have to be in the global memory.
Even if the above two weren't a problem, we would still have race conditions between threads when updating the hash map.

What would be a good way in order to approach this problem?
Thank you in advance

I have implemented my own comparator for STL's sort function, that helps sorting a std::vector< std::vector<int> > on the CPU. 
The user gives as an input a std::vector< std::vector<int> > and also a string variable like for example 021. By having this string the sorting is done first on the first column, then on the third column and then on the second column. Example:
Let's say the string is 10
The output will be
My CPU implementation uses a class called Sorting, this class is implemented with the following two files:
Sorting.h
Sorting.cpp
Comparator.h
My implementation has been tested and it works properly. I'm interested in doing a similar CUDA implementation that would take advantage of GPU's capabilities in order to produce the output much more faster.
Initially I thought because my goal is a bit confusing, maybe changing an already known implementation for sorting in the GPU would do my job. However I started searching many implementations like the one described here: http://blogs.nvidia.com/2012/09/how-tesla-k20-speeds-up-quicksort-a-familiar-comp-sci-code/ and it made me realize that it would be something difficult to achieve.
I'm not sure if this is the best course of action. I started searching for libraries and found Thrust. However, although Thrust allows you to define your own comparator, in a question I asked yesterday I learned that it's not possible to create a host_vector < host_vector<int> >.
And I guess transforming my vector of vectors to a single vector wouldn't help me that much because I have no idea how I would then have to implement my comparator class.
I would like to hear your opinion on this issue:

how should I approach this problem? 
Is it possible to achieve it with Thrust?
Would doing it in the GPU give a much better performance on my overall code? Note that the vector of vectors can be huge, millions of rows but only a few(5-10) columns.
Would it be better to design my own sort or change a sort function that is already available? This although sounds like a good idea, in practice I feel like it would take me a lot of effort to achieve. Using a simple comparator and a sort function from a library would be the best for me, however the limitations of Thrust don't allow me to do so.

Assume we have a function that returns one million integer vectors of length 30 each with smallish entries (between -100 and 100, say). Assume further that the output has only about 30000 unique vectors, the rest being duplicates. What is a good data structure and algorithm to retrieve the list of unique output vectors? Preferably the solution should scale well when the proportion of 3% unique vectors is roughly constant.
This question is mostly about the data structure, but I'm planning to implement this in C++ using the STL, so any hints on the implementation are welcome too.

The naive algorithm is to store the list of known vectors (potentially sorted lexicographically). When a new vector arrives we can check if it is already in the list using a loop (or search in a sorted list).
Hashing: Let's assume the vectors are stored in C-arrays. What is a good hash function for integer vectors? A drawback I see is that every component of every vector is touched at least once.  This seems too much already.
Would any tree data structure be good? For instance we could store the value in the first component of all seen vectors as roots and then the value in the second component as their children, ...

18160762,"C++ Quick Sort Implementation, not having the right output","
I am implementing the quick sort algorithm from Cormen's Algorithm book(CLRS).
it has no error, but it can not sort the numbers.
The pseudo code in the book is like the following.

Quicksort(A, p, r)
if p < r
q = Partition(A, p, r)
Quicksort(A, p, q-1)
Quicksort(A, q+1, r)
Partition(A, p, r)
x = A[r]
i = p - 1
for j = p to r - 1
___i= i+1;
___exchange A[i] with A[j]
exchange A[i+1] with A[r]
return i + 1;

My implementation is like the following.
Anybody has any idea about my code? It works, but does not do the sorting.
For example, if I input 
shuffle: 13, 0, -6, 6, -2, 5, 4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 2, 7, 
output is like the following
My_Quick_Sort: -6, -2, 0, 6, 13, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 3, 7,

18151322,In C++ using NaCl how to sort a JSON object by value?,"
I'm using PicoJSON to handle JSON that I get from JavaScript into C++.
If I have a JSON with keys and values of the form {""val1"":3, ""val2"":4} I can get the value of every specific key like so:
The problem is that I have an array of objects coming from JavaScript in the form of JSON that look like [{""name"": 3},{""name"": 1},{""name"": 2}]. So now the code will look like this:
I am expected to sort them so the expected output should be:

Do I have to use a 'for loop' with a linked list to somehow extract that data to sort it? If so, how?
Maybe this can be extracted using regular expressions? If so, how?
Should the array can be converted into array of arrays in order to sort it? If so, how?
Do I have to build a struct or a vector to get a sortable data structure recognisable by
C++? If so, how?

Note: The number of elements varies - it can be greater/smaller.
EDIT:
Can this task be solved if the data structure is in this form (just like I had with {""val1"":3, ""val2"":4} ) :
I am flexible to changing it so that C++ would be able to handle it.
Would it then be possible to traverse every key and sort in by value ? If yes, how to do it?

18125026,c++ code to sort text file doesn't works,"
A friend left me a code that should open 2 files solution.txt and priority.csv and generate a 3rd file result.txt as an output.

solution.txt contains an ordered list of target, names and values separated by commas, and I know how many line the file contains:




some of solution.txt's lines contain only a target value:


target3

priority.csv contains an indexed list of colornames, I know how many colornames there are:


1,colorname1
2,colorname2
3,colorname3

The code below should do the following:

ask how many lines of data solution.txt contains
ask how many colornames are contained in priority.csv
put the name(s) and associated value(s) of solution.txt in the order defined by priority.csv
create an array that contains as many columns as the number of colors, and as many lines as in solution.txt
fill this array with the value(s) associated to each line & colorname
fill the other cases with 0

The code doesn't work for some reasons I don't understand. If you have the courage to compile it, here are examples to put in solution.txt and priority.txt :

ANSWER
As suggested by @livingissuicide the problem was that getSigma() needs to return a reference(i.e. sth constant, @PhoenixX_2). The explanation why  it needs to return a reference (and why just a simple copy doesn't suffice) is because 

The problem is that there are two calls to getSigma, producing two different vectors. A pair of iterators passed to sort is not a valid range - the two iterators point into different containers.

After searching the net I came to know that the bit-wise version of the sieve of eratosthenes is pretty efficient.
The problem is I am unable to understand the math/method it is using.
The version that I have been busy with looks like this: 
Points that I understood (Please correct me if I am wrong):    

Statement in line 1 checks if the number is composite.
Statement    in line 2 marks the number 'n' as composite.
The program is storing    the value 0 or 1 at a bit of an int. This tends to reduce the memory    usage to x/32. (x is the size that would have been used had an int    been used to store the 0 or 1 instead of a bit like in my solution    above)

Points that are going above my head as of now :

How is the finction in LINE 1 functioning.How is the function making sure that the number is composite or not.
How is function in LINE 2 setting the bit.
I also came to know that the bitwise sieve is timewise efficient as
well. Is it because of the use of bitwise operators only or
something else is contributing to it as well.

I want to unique an array of n elements.

Luckily, there is something help to design the algorithm: 

The elements fit in the 64-bit unsigned integer( uint64_t ). Since the elements are generated by a hash function, so we can assume it satisfies uniform distribution( ~U(0, 2^64-1) ).

  stricter still.

And I also read the definition of strict weak ordering in the document: StrictWeakOrdering

The first three axioms, irreflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity,

  is required by the definition of a strict weak ordering. A total
  ordering is one that satisfies an even stronger condition: equivalence
  must be the same as equality.

I am not quite sure about these definition. Some main questions:
1.Is partial ordering implicitly define a equivalence?
2.What about strict weak ordering and total ordering?
3.STL require a strict weak ordering in sort algorithms, why isn't partial ordering or total ordering?
For this question, I've read some textbooks that prove a valid comparing rules by proving the rule satisfy three axioms: irreflexivity, antisymmetry, transitivity which is the definition for partial ordering, and the document refer that operator< always satisfies this definition, So why can't we just compare objects using partial ordering, or equivalently, using operator

Measure the distance between all A-B pairs, save it in an 2D array of floats.
Sort the 2D array as individual values, something like the sort lambda below:
Set the best match for that A, disable searching for the selected B and A (disable a column and a row in 2D).
Select the smallest number from the still available array.
etc. etc, till all matches are made.

18515772,Parallelizing std::nth_element and std::partition,"
I'm porting C++ code which uses std::nth_element and std::partition to OpenCL.  
nth_element is a selection algorithm which places the nth-smallest number in an array at the nth spot, and arranges the remaining elements so that all elements less than this number are before it in the array, and all elements greater than it are after it.  In effect, nth_element sorts the array into 3 buckets: the number itself, all the numbers less than it, and all the numbers greater than it.
Canonically, nth_element is implemented using a recursive partition: an element is chosen, the elements are partitioned based on whether they're less than this element.  Then, pick the bucket which contains the nth element of the array and recurse on that bucket.  The main difference between nth_element and a full quicksort is that quicksort recurses on both buckets, not just the one containing the nth element.

partition is a weaker version of nth_element which only sorts the array into 2 buckets: those for which a condition is true, and those for which it is false.  The site I linked to gives the implementation:
where pred is a function that evaluates whether an element should be in the first bucket.  Basically, this function iteratively finds the outermost pair of elements of the array which are in the wrong place, and swaps them, stopping when the pair of elements are the same element.

Here are my initial ideas on parallelizing nth_element and partition:
Partition could be implemented using atomic comparisons and swaps, but I'm not sure how to cover all the possible pairs of values which could be swapped.  There's no obvious way to divide the work among multiple threads, since partition requires comparing elements which may be either right next to each other or at opposite ends of the array.  I also don't see a way to avoid having thread B compare with an element which has already been swapped by thread A, which is inefficient.
nth_element seems even less parallelizable, since it is recursive: each partition depends upon the elements having been partially ordered by the previous partition.
Presumably, an efficient parallelization strategy will require a completely different approach than the typical serial code, for both functions.

Do efficient parallel implementations of nth_element and partition already exist?  If not, what is a good parallelization strategy?

I very recently learnt quicksort. I read that pivot selection plays a very important role in the overall performance. 
I had an assignment where I was supposed to test 3 variations of pivot selection - randomized, median of three and median of medians on varying input sizes. 
I had read that the median of medians version is will not run in O(n2) even in worst case. But in my results, randomized and median of three versions gave almost similar results, with median of three doing slightly better, but median of medians is performing very poorly by several orders of magnitude. For instance, on input size of 50000, the randomized version ran in 16547 us while the median of medians ran in 1139168 us.
Can somebody explain why is this happening? (As far as I know I have implemented the pivot selection algorithm correctly- diving array into sets of 5, taking median of each set and again doing this recursively till I get the median.)  Am I doing something wrong?
Edit: I am rechecking the code just in case, but is it normal for the median of medians implementation to work just as slow or even slower(if only marginally) than the other two implementations or is it guaranteed to work much faster?
Edit2: Here's the code which I use for finding median of medians, the value that it finds is returned to the quicksort function to use as pivot. I am sure that the code  violates all good coding practices, please ascribe this to my noob-ishness and try to look beyond it.

18309866,Why does quicksort take longer when sorted in descending order vs ascending order,"
I have code for quicksort and mergesort, and I've placed a global counter variable that gets incremented for every iteration(comparison) that is made.  I would assume this would correspond to my rough asymptotic analysis.  For merge sort it does, but for quicksort it doesn't.  I don't understand why.  I'm choosing the last element of the input array is the pivot in every iteration.  I know that this is non-optimal, but that doesn't matter for the sake of this discussion.  Since I'm choosing the last element, I would expect that both ascending and descending order arrays would result in O(n^2) comparisons.  To be more specific, I would expect that the number of comparisons would be n choose 2, because you are adding n + n-1 + n-2 + n-3 + .... + 1 in the worst case.  But this does not seem to be happening.  
On an input size of 100,000, with the input sorted in descending order I get 705,082,704 iterations counted.  I get the same number for an input array sorted in ascending order. But 100,000 choose 2 is around 5 billion.  Why the discrepancy? 
For merge sort, with an input of 100,000, I get approx 1.6 million iterations, which is seemingly correct.  
The following is the code which includes my implementation of quicksort as well as my counting technique, both of which may be off and thus causing this discrepancy.  Otherwise it must be that my logic is wrong about how many iterations this should take?
Also, as an aside, its curious to me that although the number of comparisons are the same in both the ascending and descending input arrays, the ascending version is 2-3 times as fast.  What could account for that.  Without further ado here is the code.

19602288,Wrong sub array is getting executed in Mergesort,"
I have implemented merge sort using recursion. The code for the two functions involved is below:
However, during the recursion process, if the merged sub-array is for example 1,2,5, then the next time it is used in the merged function, the array gets used as 2,1,5 or something else randomly. Hence, I do not get the correct output for the sort. For instance, I entered the unsorted array as 3,5,1,4,2.
Here what happens is that the merge sort proceeds correctly till the stage where one of my merged array 2,4 that is formed during the merge function, becomes 4,2 when it used to calculate the bigger sub-array. Hence the merge sort goes wrong. Please help me out on where I am going wrong.

19599914,Issue with Merge Sort implementation in C++,"
I am getting two errors in implementing the algorithm from pseudocode:
One of my problems is int L[n1+1]; error: needs to be a constant; cannot allocate constant size 0. The only way to run this is to make the size a number like 10. I may be implementing the psuedocode wrong that is why I included the statement above that. This may be the cause of my next problem.
My other problem is I am printing only one line of code unsorted. My print function is flawless and works for all of the sorting programs. I believe the MERGE function is only running once. I posted the output of the Sort at the bottom.
I have a random number generator for the array A, from 0 to RAND_MAX.

19585110,Should I use vector or set in my special situation? Or something entirely different?,"
So, I've spent many hours reading various questions, blog posts, articles, etc. about performance comparisons of different STL containers in different situations.
However, I was not yet able to find a good source for my exact situation (3D game):
I am collecting a large number (definitely more than 5k, likely below 50k) of pointers to some class (it's exact nature is not relevant I think) and want to sort them by a single float value which determines their distance to some arbitrary position (which does not change during the frame).
After that, I want to iterate over each stored pointer. The order is important here, hence the sorting. 
Here is the situation in pseudocode:
This whole process is (potentially) repeated each frame in the game, so the optimal performance here is kinda important. The container must be cleared before A each time. After C, nothing else is done with it.
What I do NOT (I repeat, NOT) need:

Random access to the container.
The ability to insert new elements after the container has been sorted.

Currently, what I figured would be fastest is either using a vector or a set. But I don't know if - in my situation - it would be faster to insert the elements into the vector, then sort it, then iterate over each element once. Or if it would be faster to insert the elements into a set (thus sorting them during the insertion) and then iterating over each element once.
We're also using boost in our project for some other tasks, so if anyone knows a better solution inside boost (or something else entirely), I'm very open for suggestions. Also, sorry if this question has already been answered and I just didn't find it :)

However, traversing the linked list (I am using the sorted list as a lookup to grab objects from an unordered_map) is likely to be much slower because the memory is scattered throughout the heap.
I was thinking of using a map, but wouldn't this also have a bad memory access due to the non-continuous nature?
A statically-allocated array (with lots of empty space) and a fast sorting algorithm is another idea I thought upon.....

I have a std::vector of indices pointing into a data array, and I want to sort this list by the value of the array. This works fine for an array of known data type using the following:
However, now my data comes in different data types, and I've templated the DoStuff method as follows:
The problem I have is, that I don't find the correct syntax to pass this templating on into my SortByValue struct (which needs to keep the pointer to the data of correct type.) I tried (and failed) with templating the struct too:
So how do I have to do this? Can someone post a code-example?

20057842,Implementing a sort class using templates,"
I posted last night about an array class, and now I'm having trouble with a sorting class. About half of the functions are defined, either by the professor or by the algorithms he gave us, but a lot of the definitions are confusing me. I'm not sure what makes them any different from the ones above it.
I also noticed that there is a void insertionSort(Array<T> &a); function, but the algorithm I was given is:
Am I supposed to implement this the same way, just replacing int a[] with, say... &arr? I'm guessing since this includes array.h and the array class has T * arr;, I should be pointing to the address of that array? Would this also work for each definition that has the address operator in its parameter?

When using std::sort, how can I overload the custom comparison function that I am using?
I can't get this to compile as it complains about:

I can see that using sortPair could be somewhat ambiguous, but I assumed that the compiler would be able to resolve this based on the types associated with the vector u. Is there some way that I could specify which function/method to use in order to disambiguate the problem?
Currently, commenting out the first sortPair function allows the code to be compiled and produces the correct sorted output. Of course, this is because it is not longer ambiguous.

20027656,How can I sort and check an array for duplicates in C++?,"
The problem I'm trying to solve is checking an array as the user is inputting values into the array. The specific instructions are: to use a separate method to do the checking; the method must sort the array first; the duplicate check has to be performed in real-time, meaning the user won't first enter all values then the array go back and check them. I've looked around and while I've figured out how to sort, I am completely stumped as to how to check for duplicates as each value is entered. Can anyone nudge me in the right direction of thinking?
This is what I came up with, working within the limits of the assignment:
It compiles and runs without any bugs (none that I've caught yet, anyway). If anyone has any feedback it'd be appreciated. I know this kind of algorithm is highly inefficient but our arrays are only 7 values long and this is what was asked for. Initially I thought it had to be sorted, but that was only required if we chose to do the check in a different function.

How can I sort them alternatively with time complexity less than O(n^2) and space complexity O(1)?
For this example, the result would be: {1,8,3,6,5,4,7,2};
I can't use external array storage but temporary variables are acceptable. 
I have tried to use two pointers(oddPtr, evenPtr) to point odd and even numbers separately, and move evenPtrto insert the even values to the middles of odd numbers.(Like insertion sort)
But it takes O(n^2).

19989751,Why is my heapsort faster than Javas and C++s sort functions?,"
I recently learned how to use heaps and the beauty of heapsort. I decided to compare heapsort with std::sort in C++ and Arrays.sort() in Java. I sorted an array of integers, each randomly generated in the range of <0; 2000000000)
I generated 100,000,000 integers into an array in Java, and ran Arrays.sort(), then generated new random sequence and ran my heapSort(). This is an output of my program in Java:
So heapsort is about 8 times faster.
I then ran similar code in C++, this time using std::vector as my container (due to the fact that std::sort needs two iterators).
C++ results: 
So in my program, std::sort is about 12 times slower.
In Java, I measured time using System.currentTimeMilis() and in C++ I used clock() from .
This was tested on Windows 7, Quad-Core Intel i5 2500k, overclocked to 4.8GHz. C++ was compiled with -Wall -pedantic flags.
Can anyone tell me what is going on? Is heapsort really that much faster? Or did I make an mistake in my code? I don't want to flood this post with lots of code, so I will link it at the end of this post.
BTW: Yes, I'm aware that Arrays.sort() is stable and heapsort isn't. Java doesn't have an unstable sort (atleast, I haven't found one). That is why I used std::sort in C++, to see if it had something to do with stability or not.

I have some performance critical code that involves sorting a very short fixed-length array with between around 3 and 10 elements in C++ (the parameter changes at compile time).
It occurred to me that a static sorting network specialised to each possible input size would perhaps be a very efficient way to do this: We do all the comparisons necessary to figure out which case we are in, then do the optimal number of swaps to sort the array. 
To apply this, we use a bit of template magic to deduce the array length and apply the correct network:
Obviously it's quite a hassle to code all this up, so:

Does anyone have any opinions on whether or not this is worth the effort?
Does anyone know if this optimisation exists in any standard implementations of, for example, std::sort? 
Is there an easy place to get hold of code implementing this kind of sorting network?
Perhaps it would be possible to generate a sorting network like this statically using template magic..

For now I just use insertion sort with a static template parameter (as above), in the hope that it will encourage unrolling and other compile-time optimisations.
Your thoughts welcome.

19738416,C++ Algorithm to Filter Irrelevant Coordinate Data,"
I'm currently working on a hobby project in which I have several thousand stars in a 2D fictional universe. I need to render these stars to the screen, but clearly I don't want to have to operate on all of them -- only the ones that are visible at any given time.
For proof of concept, I wrote a brute force algorithm that would look at every star and test its coordinates against the bounds of the player's screen:
While this clunky method does, indeed, draw only the visible stars to the screen, it clearly operates in linear time. Since stars are only part of the background and, frankly, aren't the most important thing for the processor to be spending time filtering through, I'd like to devise a faster algorithm to reduce some of the load.
So, my current train of thought is along the lines of using binary search to find the relevant stars. For this, I would clearly need to sort my data. However, I wasn't really sure how I could go about sorting my coordinate data -- I couldn't think of any absolute ordering that would allow me to properly sort my data in ascending order (with regards to both x and y coordinates).
So, I implemented two new containers -- one for the data sorted by x coordinate, and the other by y coordinate. My original thought was to take the intersection of these two sorted sets and draw the resulting stars to screen (stars whose x and y coordinates lie within the screen bounds):
I then sorted these containers:
Unfortunately, I cannot seem to either come up with an appropriate comparison function for std::set_intersection or a method through which I could manually compare coordinates using my iterators.
Could you guys point me in the right direction? Feedback on my methodology or implementation is very welcome.

19698549,Why heaps instead of a sorted container,"
I'm studying the c++ stl algorithms and am trying to understand the heap ones (make_heap, sort_heap, push_heap, etc).  I understand the binary tree it creates and how this would be useful for finding the highest priority item at any given time efficiently.  It's not clear to me though how this would be better than maintaining a sorted container in which the highest valued item could simply be popped off the top.
Here's the comparisons, as I see it:
For heaps:

Create the heap:      make_heap: O(nlogn) ...wrong!  O(n)
Insertion:              push_heap: O(logn)
Remove highest:      pop_heap: O(logn) 
Get sorted list:      sort_heap: O(nlogn)

For a sorted container:

Initial sort:      sort() O(nlogn)
Insertion:            ?  O(logn)
Remove highest:        pop constant
Get sorted list:      already sorted constant

Insertion would require finding the element with the same value or the two elements on either side of the value.  In a sorted list this should be O(logn).  I don't know a particular algorithm that would do this yet.
In any case, what am I missing?  It seems from my analysis above that just maintaining a sorted container is no worse in all cases and better in some.
Thanks!

Edit:
I want to point this out so no one reads this and becomes confused by my question.  As rici pointed out, I was mistaken about the complexity of make_heap.  I initially thought it was O(n log n), but instead it's O(n).  That difference, for me, explains why make_heap would be better than simply maintaining a sorted list.

20487098,Inserting data and sort into multidimensional vectors,"
I'm trying to insert data based on a given value - strBeg. I want the vectors to be sorted numerically based on this value. There are two different vectors. With my driver program shown below I would want the output to be:
As you can see the value of refBeg/refEnd does not affect the order, but must stay with it's strBeg/strEnd pair. I've posted my code below...it does not work. My current method is going to require a very large sorting function accounting for many different cases and I would like to avoid that if possible. I'm wondering if there is a more efficient way to implement this? I've though about combining the two vectors into one that will have 4 columns but would rather not as this will make it more confusing to understand (but am not completely opposed if it's the best/easiest option). Also there will be no overlap in linei, as in there will not be two sets of data with the same strBeg and strBeg/strEnd will not fall in between another strings start and stop points. I read through some other similar questions but couldn't quite figure out how to adapt them to my situation. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!

20471456,Sorting QtTableModel - QTableView doesn't get updated,"
I implemented a custom QAbstractTableModel and I'm using a std::vector for my data objects.
Now I wanted to implement the sort() method, to get my table sorted by column. 
That's basically what I do:
void SBStateTableModel::sort (int column, Qt::SortOrder order)
{
emit layoutAboutToBeChanged();

switch (column)
{
case Address:
    if (order == Qt::DescendingOrder)
        std::sort(states.begin(), states.end(), addr_comp_desc);
    else
        std::sort(states.begin(), states.end(), addr_comp_asc);

default:
    return;
}

emit layoutChanged();
}

But emitting layoutChanged() alone doesn't redraw the view. When mark a row and cycle through them, they get updated as they are being highlighted. 
The documentation also speaks about updating the persistent indexes. Some people on here have suggested, that this is in fact not necessary. 
I'm not even sure how to go about it. Getting the list with persistentIndexList() and then I have to sort it. But std::sort is not a stable sort. I'm not sure how to match the persistent indices with my vector indices.
EDIT:
There was just a ""break"" missing in the 'case'! So the function would return before emitting the layoutChanged signal.

I have a homework that I am trying to complete in C++. It has multiple tasks that needs to be completed.

I have been able to do number 1 through 3 without much issue. But I am stumped on how to search through an array of strings and find names with same alphabets to count and display them? Please keep in mind I am very new to C++ and would like a nudge in the right direction to get this sorted!!!
Okay, so i was able to create a function to sort the names
I am still not able to do this though: Create a function to count how many last names begin with each letter and output the names and the total number of names each time. This function should be passed the array by value and the size of the array by value. The function should output the names that begin with a particular letter then output the total number of names. Do NOT output results for letters that do not have any names, i.e. for example ther are no names that begin with B, so no output should be generated for this letter. This is my first time asking a question in StackOverflow so if I cannot explain it correctly I apologize.

Begin the program by creating a random array of 6 values between 1 and 49.  Make sure that you use the time() function and srand to seed the rand() function.  Display the resulting data using a displaydata function that you pass the array (and it’s size) into.
Have the user determine whether they wish to use a bubble sort to sort the array or selection sort.  Once the user has made their decision have the program call either the bubblesort or selectionsort function (with the random array and its size as arguments) which sorts the array and calls the displaydata function (with the sorted array as an argument).

I'm working on a project in C++ which deals with comma separated data (CSV).  What I do is reading the data from a .csv file into a vector of CsvRow objects.
So, today I encountered a really weird std::bad_alloc exceptions being thrown in much more weird situations. Namely, the first test case in which I managed to get a little more time until I get the exception thrown was reading a whole csv file into a vector. The file consists of 500,000 rows and its size is about 70MB.  The file was read into memory like a charm, but then after a few seconds into the sorting procedure, the std::bad_alloc gets thrown. It used roughly 67MB of RAM
Note: I'm using boost's flyweights in order to reduce memory consumption.
BUT, this test case was even stranger:
I'm reading a 146KB file with a few hundreds of lines, and this time I got the exception while reading the data into a vector, which is totally ridiculous having a 70MB successfully read previously.
I'm suspecting a memory-leak, but my machine has 8GB of RAM, using 64-bit Windows 8.
I'm using CodeBlocks, and a MinGW 64-bit boost distro.
Any help would be appreciated. 
Here is a chunk of code in which the std::bad_alloc is being thrown: 

Reading data from a csv file

Sorting the vector using a internal struct stored in my class  


Then, I'm using std::sort() to sort the vector of CsvRows
This line looks really suspicious, but I could not figure out an easier way to initialize those hash sets. 
Deleting those hash sets in the destructor crashes the program (SIGSEGV)
Oh, and another thing to point out is that I can't use the default 32-bit gdb debugger due to my MinGW being 64-bit.  The 32bit gdb is bugged and won't work with MinGW 64.
Edit:
Could the boost::flyweight<std::string> which I use in the CsvRow class cause the problem?
In addition to that, here is a part of the CsvRow class:
And the overloaded [] operator on the CsvRow class:  
Thanks in advance
 EDIT - SOLVED: 
So, this question solved my problem, although I didn't even think of it.
Every custom comparator we pass to the std::sort() has to be a strict weak ordering, that is being:
1. Irreflexive
2. Asymmetric
3. Transitive
4. Transitivity of incomparability
More info at :This question and This Wiki article
Actually, I did not follow the first one (irreflexivity), that is, if both of the CsvRow objects are equal, it should not ""compare"" them and return true as if they were okay, but instead return false.
I solved the whole problem by only changing the default return value when both CsvRow a and CsvRow b are equal.
Thanks to everyone who tried to help.

I recently stumbled upon a little problem.
Part of an algorithm I was working on needed to find n consecutive numbers in a sorted list of numbers.
So, for example, the list would look something like this:
Given that list and N, the amount of consecutive duplicates, the algorithm needed to find the first number in the smallest group of exactly N consecutive numbers. So for example with N = 2 and the given list, the algorithm should find ""2"". With N = 3 it should pass the group of 2's, find the group of 5's instead since it's the smallest group of 3 consecutive duplicates in that list. It shouldn't return 9 since there are actually 4 consecutive 9's and with N = 3 we are looking for the smallest group of exactly 3 consecutives.
I did in the end cobble together some peace of crap code that did the job, but I was wondering how would some experienced programmer do this. Utilizing as much of the C++11 Style of Code advertised by Stroustroup himself and using as much of the C++11 STL for correctness, portability and compactness for reasoning.

I started to implement with boost::circular_buffer.
If boost::heap is better for this, which boost::heap should i use? Because there are a few(fibonacci, binomial, priority queue...)
I am using boost 1_49 but i can use a newer version also.
With circular buffer i insert most of the elements at the beginning of the buffer. But it can be O(n) in some case.
But to take timed out element it is O(1)

I know SELECT * FROM table1 ORDER BY Col1, Col2 would return the table sorted but from an actually memory stand point all the data is the table is still the same, so if col 1 was all out of order after the ORDER BY the database viewer would still show col 1 all out of order.

Given a string, I'm trying to count the occurrence of each letter in the string and then sort their frequency from highest to lowest. Then, for letters that have similar number of occurrences, I have to sort them alphabetically.
Here is what I have been able to do so far:

I created an int array of size 26 corresponding to the 26 letters of the alphabet with individual values representing the number of times it appeared in the sentence
I pushed the contents of this array into a vector of pairs, v, of int and char (int for the frequency, and char for the actual letter)
I sorted this vector of pairs using std::sort(v.begin(), v.end());

In displaying the frequency count, I just used a for loop starting from the last index to display the result from highest to lowest. I am having problems, however, with regard to those letters having similar frequencies, because I need them displayed in alphabetical order. I tried using a nested for loop with the inner loop starting with the lowest index and using a conditional statement to check if its frequency is the same as the outer loop. This seemed to work, but my problem is that I can't seem to figure out how to control these loops so that redundant outputs will be avoided. To understand what I'm saying, please see this example output:
As you can see, it would have been fine if it wasn't for the redundant outputs brought about by the incorrect for loops.
If you can suggest more efficient or better implementations with regard to my concern, then I would highly appreciate it as long as they're not too complicated or too advanced as I am just a C++ beginner.

How have/would you design an function that on each call returns the next value in a nominated numeric range in lexicographical order of string representation...?

Example: range 8..203 --> 10, 100..109, 11, 110..119, 12, 120..129, 13, 130..139, ..., 19, 190..199, 20, 200..203, 30..99.
Constraints: indices 0..~INT_MAX, fixed space, O(range-length) performance, preferably ""lazy"" so if you stop iterating mid way you haven't wasted processing effort.  Please don't post brute force ""solutions"" iterating numerically while generating strings that are then sorted.
Utility: if you're generating data that ultimately needs to be lexicographically presented or processed, a lexicographical series promises lazy generation as needed, reduces memory requirements and eliminates a sort.
Background: when answering this question today, my solution gave output in numeric order (i.e. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), not lexicographical order (10, 11, 12, 8, 8) as illustrated in the question.

For full-word keys consisting of random bits, the starting point in Program 10.1 should be the leftmost bit of the words, or bit 0. In general, the starting point that should be used depends in a straightforward way on the application, on the number of bits per word in the machine, and on the machine representation of integers and negative numbers.

21757943,Sorting C++ Arrays of user-defined objects using Pointers?,"
This is my first question, so please give me feedback not only on the question but on how I asked it as well (please and thank you).
In my last assignment for CS 201 we designed a class representing an airline flight, it contains some private data:
Part of the assignment was to display all departures or arrivals (as selected by the user) for a single airport. For extra credit, the output was to be sorted in ascending order (earliest time first). The instructor has not taught us how to use std::sort from  so the idea (I assume) was to devise our own method of sorting.
My thinking was to fill an array of Flight pointers according to the results of a sort; however I ran into a problem. Here is my code to do the sorting:
I looked over the output to see what the problem was and I realized that all the pointers were pointing to the same flight (which did, indeed, have the earliest arrival time). This led me to believe that the problem was that my code was not excluding flights which had already been placed into pointerArray.
Outside of ""blanking"" the flight that I just pointed to (which defeats the purpose of the pointer) I could not find any way of ""ignoring"" flights which already had pointers pointing at them.
How can I have solved this problem?
I would like to make it clear that I have already solved the problem in a very hack-y way. I am not happy with the solution because I feel it is not optimal but it works. I am not attempting to have SO do my assignment, just help to make me a better programmer

I have a vector of pairs:
I want to sort only a subset of elements (on the first's string).  The Cell has method GetSorted() which indicates if it's part of this subset or not.
This is what I had initially:
But it does not work, because sort, of course, does not compare all combinations.  Sometimes the return a.first < b.first line is not even executed once.
To define the required sort function, here's an example.  Suppose the elements are:
Only the *-ones need to be sorted.  But, the sort should only be applied to adjacent to-be-sorted elements.  (That's why I had a.second->GetSorted() && b.second->GetSorted().)  The result should then be:
So, only A and C are adjacent, and are sorted.  Is there an easy solution to this problem?
Alternatively a solution that results in:
would also be usable for me at the moment.  So, sorting all * elements, while leaving the others where they are.  This appears to be easier to do.

This is the CSortedList.cpp file, where I'm having trouble doing what I want to do.
For example, under the InsertItem function, I'm having trouble sorting the list.
The MoveListItem function is there in order to help sort the list by adding/removing items as needed - it was provided by the professor for this assignment, and I don't think it needs to be changed but I could be wrong. 
The RemoveItem function should do exactly what it says - if I were to remove an item from the list, it should be moving the items inside the array 'to the front', with the help of the MoveListItem function. 
Finally, per the directions, our professor gave us this function - GetTargetIndex, but I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with it nor how I'm supposed to use it to help with the coding. 
In conclusion, my problems are these: I don't understand what 'GetListItem' and 'GetTargetIndex' are supposed to do - they just seem redundant and completely unnecessary, but I can't just not use them because obviously they're there for a reason. 
Currently, when I try to sort my list with the given code (inside of 'InsertItem'), the last value is 'lost', so for example if I enter the following:
12
15
3
The following will be displayed:
3
12
3
Instead of what's supposed to be displayed:
3
12
15
And removing a value from the list ('RemoveItem') is just not working at all. If I enter
12
15
3
And I select to remove '3', this displays:
12
3

21434718,"Approximate sort (array/vector), predictable runtime","
Background:
I need to process some hundred thousand events (producing results) given a hard time limit. The clock is literally ticking, and when the timer fires, whatever is done at that point must be flushed out.
What isn't ready by that time is either discarded (depending on an importance metric) or processed during the next time quantum (with an ""importance boost"", i.e. adding a constant to the importance metric).
Now ideally, the CPU is much faster than needed, and the whole set is ready a long time before the end of the time slice. Unluckily, the world is rarely ever ideal, and ""hundred thousands"" becomes ""tens of millions"" before you know.
Events are added to the back of a queue (which is really a vector) as they come in, and are processed from the front during the respective next quantum (so the program always processes the last quantum's input).
However, not all events are equally important. In case the available time is not sufficient, it would be preferrable to drop unimportant events rather than important ones (this is not a strict requirement, since important events will be copied to the next time quantum's queue, but doing so further adds to the load so it isn't a perfect solution).
The obvious thing to use would be, of course, a priority queue / heap. Unluckily, heapifying 100k elements isn't precisely a free operation either (or parallel), and then I end up with objects being in some non-obvious and not necessarily cache-friendly memory locations, and pulling elements from a priority queue doesn't parallelize nicely.
What I would really like is somewhat like a vector that is sorted or at least ""somewhat approximately sorted"", which one can traverse sequentially afterwards. This would trivially allow me to create e.g. 12 threads (or any other number, one per CPU) that process e.g. 1/64 of the range (or another size) each, slowly advancing from the front to the end, and eventually dropping/postponing what's left over -- which will be events of little importantance that can be discarded.
Simply sorting the complete range using std::sort would be the easiest, most straightforward solution. However, the time it takes to sort items reduces the time available to actually process elements within the fixed time budget, and sorting time is for the most part single-CPU time (and parallel sort isn't that great either).
Also, doing a perfect sort (which isn't really needed) may bring forth worst case complexity whereas an approximate sort should ideally perform at its optimum and have a very predictable cost.
tl;dr
So, what I'm looking for is a way to sort an array/vector only approximately, but fast, and with a predictable (or guaranteed) runtime.
The sort key would be a small integer typically between 10 and 1000. Being postponed to the next time quantum might increase (""priority boost"") that value by a small amount, e.g. 100 or 200.
In a different question where humans are supposed to do an approximate sort using ""subjective compare""(?) shell sort was proposed. On various sorting demo applets, it seems like at least for the ""random shuffle"" input that's typical in these, shell sort can indeed do an ""approximate sort"" that doesn't look too bad with 3-4 passes over the data (and at least the read-tap is strictly sequential). Unluckily it seems to be somewhat of a black art to choose gap values that work well, and runtime estimates seem to involve a lot of looking into the crystal ball as well.
Comb sort with a relatively large shrink factor (such as 2 or 3?) seems tempting as well, since it visits memory strictly sequentially (on both taps) and is able to move far out elements by a great distance quickly. Again, judging from sorting demo applets, it seems like 3-4 passes already give a rather reasonable ""approximate sort"".
MSD radix sort comes to mind, though I am not sure how it would perform given typical 16/32bit integers in which most of the most significant bits are all zero! One would probably have to do an initial pass to find the most significant bit in the whole set, followed by 2-3 actual sort passes?
Is there a better algorithm or a well-known working approach with one of the algorithms I mentioned?

just a quick (hahaha) question regarding my naive quicksort algorithm:
When I run the code it on a test array, it seems that only the left side of the array (the less than side) is sorted and never jumps to sorting the right side and creates an infinite loop.

21179413,How to sort a 2D array using the sort function in c++?,"
I have an n x m array that I need sorted. However, I only need to look at the first value of each 1d array to sort the larger array. For example, consider the following 2d array:
[[1, 2], [4, 4], [3, 5]]
I don't care about the second values in the subarrays. I just need to look at the first value of subarray to sort it. So, I would only look at 1, 4, 3. Sorting it, I get: 1, 3, 4. But the whole 2d array should look like:
[[1, 2], [3, 5], [4, 4]]
I tried implementing this in c++ with the standard sort algorithm:
However, passing it to the function and compiling doesn't give an error in my source file. Instead the compiler opens up stl_algo.h and points the following error:

Rearranging cartons
Your school has ordered some equipment that has been delivered in a number of very heavy cartons. Each carton has a serial number and the cartons are all lined up in a row. Unfortunately, your teacher asked for the cartons to be placed in a particular sequence and you forgot to tell the people who unloaded the cartons about this. You now have to quickly restore the cartons to the correct order before the teacher comes and sees how you have messed up her instructions. Since the cartons are very heavy, you cannot carry them over long distances. In each step, all you can do is to exchange the position of two adjacent cartons. For instance, suppose the serial numbers on the cartons in the order in which they are unloaded are 34, 29, 12, 78 and 90 and the order in which the cartons were supposed to be arranged is 90, 29, 78, 34, 12. These cartons can be rearranged in the desired order with a minimum of 7 or higher exchanges, as follows:
In this example, it can be shown that a mimimum of 7 exchanges are needed to reorder the cartons as desired. You need to rearrange them and report the number of swap (not necessarily the minimum) you needed with the adjacent carton in order to achieve the desired order.
Input format: The first line of input is a single integer N, the total number of cartons. The second line consists of N distinct positive integers, separated by spaces, denoting the serial numbers of the N cartons in the order in which they were unloaded. The third line is another sequence of N integers, denoting the desired order in which the N cartons should be rearranged. The sequence of numbers in the third line is guaranteed to be a permutation of the sequence in the second line.
Output format: The output should be a single integer, the number of exchanges required to achieve the desired sequence of cartons.
  Here is the sample input and output corresponding to the example discussed above.
Note: Your program should not print anything other than what is specified in the output format. Please remove all diagnostic print statements before making your final submission.

21153036,what is time complexity of this code (from leetcode)?,"
The problem is ""Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. "" from leetcode
1.
My solution is to use a vector to maintain the current position of each linked list, sort the vector to get the node with minimal value and insert it at the end of the merged list. Here is the code:
Since the time complexity of std::sort is nlog(n) and we have (n1+n2...nk) iterations, thus I suppose the total time complexity is O((n1+n2...+nk)klog(k)). But at each iteration, the size of vector currNodes may vary so I'm a little bit confused. Can anyone confirm this?
2.
Also I saw another solution on leetcode discussion forum which use the thought of ""merge sort"". It merges two linked list everytime.
I wonder what is the time complexity of this solution? Since it merges two linked lists every time, there is log(n) iterations. But the linked list gets longer (since it's merged from two linked lists) after each iteration, how to compute the time complexity at each iteration and then add them up together?
Thank you in advance :)

21136337,Is it possible to define the length of the type to sort in STXXL at run time?,"
I have an application that requires a built-in sort and I'm hoping to replace the existing sort mechanism with the sort provided by STXXL. I have successfully tested it using STXXL, but my problem is that, although a specific run of the sort needs to operate on fixed length strings, the length is determined at run-time and can be anywhere between 10 bytes and 4000 bytes. Always allowing for 4000 bytes will obviously be grossly inefficient if the actual length is small.
For those not familiar with STXXL, I believe the problem roughly equates to defining a std::vector without knowing the size of the objects at compilation time. However, I'm not a C++ expert - the application is written in C.
In my test this is the type that I am sorting:  
and this is the type definition for the STXXL sorter:  
The problem is that I don't want to hard-code the array size to '80'.
The only solution I can come up with, is to define a number of structures of varying lengths and pick the closest at run-time. Am I missing a trick? Am I thinking in C rather than C++?

21109582,Thrust sort on tuples is very slow,"
I need to sort an array of tuples, so I'm defining an operator for tuples and sorting using thrust::sort.
So what I found is that sorting an array of tuples is significantly slower the sorting an array of numbers. Here is my code:
I'm getting that tuple sort is ~10X times slower than regular sort.
I don't understand why. Is the complexity of the sort in thrust is directly affected by the operator? Even though, my operator is not 10x times slower than a regular comparator.
Note:
It's not just 10x times slower:
for 100000 it's ~10x slower
for 1000000 it's ~20x slower
I also found that coping two arrays into an array of tuples and sorting that array instead is about 150% faster while the thrust::copy take almost nothing (0.3 for 1M).
Note2:
I changed my operator to this:
and now the sort is about 112.5% faster, which is probably because equals on the first value is rarely happens, this way there is less if's to check in the operator in general.

22275541,"Radix sort most significant first or least significant, which is faster?","
I have been working on a radix sort implementation (code so far pasted below). Code is in Java but should work just as well in C/C++. As you can see from the implementation I am doing it most significant bit first, the 31st bit for integers. This would seem to be faster because once a subgroup is complete, it no longer needs to be iterated.
For example, as an analogy, imagine sorting words and you only have one word that begins with ""A"". Once you see the A and place the word at the beginning of the list, you no longer have to examine any further characters in the word. On the other hand, if you begin from the end of the word, you would have to look at every letter before you figured out it belonged at the beginning of the list.
So, based on this idea, I would think MSB order would be fastest, but am I missing anything? Is LSB just as fast for some reason? I know that LSB performs ""stable sort"", but I don't see any practical benefit to this.
Note that in this implementation, a ""radix"" is a binary radix, i.e., a bit.
UPDATE
BTW In Java, this runs 5 times faster than the built in Arrays.sort (when I do an in-place sort, not a keyed sort), which is pretty cool.

This is an update to a previous question about reordering in place There was some confusion about the vector of indices. Calling the vector to be reordered vA, and the vector of indices vI, then vA should be reordered in this order, vA[vI[0]], vA[vI[1]], vA[vI[2], ... . An example usage would be to initialize vI as a set of vA.size() indices, 0 to vA.size()-1, then sort vI according to vA (compare using vA[vI[...]]). Then the reorder function could be used to sort vA according to vI.
Consider the initial vA as a permutation of a sorted vA. After sorting vI according to vA, then reordering vA according to vI ""unpermutes"" vA back to the sorted permutation. With the example functions shown below, reordering vA also reorders vI back to it's initialized state (0 to vA.size()-1).

22018163,Insertion sort issues?,"
I'm just now trying out different sorting algorithms to find out how they work.
I'm looking at this one:
It's the Insertion Sort and it sorts them from smallest to largest, however I have 2 issues:

Reversing any comparison sign doesn't change the sort order to descending.
When implementing it with my own container, it never sorts the last element. Maybe I didn't get how Begin and End should work for a container? This is how I make them:

If I have a dynamic array container that has an unsigned int size and a T* data, Begin returns an iterator that has a pointer to data[0] and End returns an iterator with a pointer to data[size - 1]. If I make end to instead return data[size], it works fine, however if the size is equal to the allocated capacity, that would overflow the buffer. So the presented insertion sort algorithm is incorrect then? I got it from this site:

22436676,Merge sort implementation in C++,"
I am learning how to implement mergesort in c++ and encountered the following problem.
This is my merge function that merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array.
At any one time, I use either CODE A or CODE B. When I use CODE A, the function executes as intended. However, when I use CODE B, the function fills the array, list, with random data. 
printArray is a custom function to print the array, list. When sorting a set of numbers, {4, 2, 6, 9}, I get this output from the printArray function:

I have a class
I have another class that contains a vector of Foo and I would like to sort the vector based on the label.
However, this fails to compile. I think it is related to the fact that I am calling getLabel() and the compiler needs me to ensure that the function is constant. If I modify the sorting function to this:
It is clearly a kludgy workaround and I would really like to understand:

Why the first version doesn't compile
Why the second version compiles
How can I modify the first version WITHOUT changing (i.e. adding const) the getLabel() method and have it compile

22418080,Where to put comparison function for use with (e.g.) std::sort?,"
If I had a class Cell, for example, which I want to sort according to the following function (x and y here being int member variables with accessors):
Where exactly is the best place to put this function so that I can use it with a functions such as std::sort?
In the examples they just have the method floating in the source file above where it is needed, but in practice I want to keep it associated with the Cell class. I know that I could override the operator< but there might be other sort methods by which I'd like to sort Cell, and I'm not a big fan of overriding operators for code clarity's sake anyhow.
At the moment I have it as a static method in my Cell.h file, so that I can call it in when sorting like so:
Is this the best practice for multiple (or even singular) custom sort functions, and is the header file the right place for them? If not, what is?

I am working on a programming challenge and I have already looked at this topics before asking:
Sorting elements of vector where each element is a pair [duplicate]
How do I sort a vector of pairs based on the second element of the pair?
And the situation is like this:
-I have my vector of pairs: vector< pair<int, int> > rank;
-And I have already implemented a predicate to compare and sort the vector of pairs by the second element and in descending order: 
The programming challenge will give repeated values for the second element, and for that cases, I must leave the first element ordered by the time it was inserted to the vector of pairs, for example:

K V
1 3
2 4

Sorted must be:

The C++11 standard guarantees that std::sort has O(n logn) complexity in the worst case. This is different from the average-case guarantee in C++98/03, where std::sort could be implemented with Quicksort (maybe combined with insertion sort for small n), which has O(n^2) in the worst case (for some specific input, such as sorted input).

I have a vector of size more than 5 million, each time I would like to pick up one element with the smallest key from the vector, and do some process on this element.

So next time if I want to pick up the element with the smallest key from the vector, I must sort the vector once again.

And then take the first value from first block and next value from the next block like:
And then jump two blocks and add next part like:
7 and 8 will be alone since there are no more parts in the last block for these two numbers.

How could I solve this problem with an algorithm when the last block might sometimes not contain a complete set of numbers?

This is my private member variable of the node structure:
This is my simple sorted function to test if the list is sorted in ascending order:
I wrote this function as a means for a simple base case if I was able to solve the sort() function recursively, alas I havn't been able to achieve that goal. NOTE: I'd be equally happy with an iterative solution as I would be with a recursive one.
Now; the merge() function ( Please note that if I can get sort working the assertion will be replaced with two calls to sort() )!
The sort function is where I'm really lost. I've looked through alot of answered questions on this site but didn't find any that really had what I was looking for. If possible I was hoping to have a function that was declared like this
and if possible I'd be even more grateful if someone could explain to me how to implement my merge() function more like this
I think it would be awesome if I could implement merge as a function that rather than assigning the merged nodes to a new List, It could easily take a another List and essentially merge sort them onto my main list like so
I do realize that there are many similar questions already answered on this site alone, so please don't just link me to another question because chances are I've seen it and came out empty-handed (for this question at least). The thing is, even after poring over the questions and responses I still havn't been able to find out the answer to MY problem. I don't want to mimic someone else's code unless I have good reason to. This is more of a learning exercise for me and I just have writer's block on the best way to do this. I'd be happy to upload any other chunks of my code, or add more commentary on my thought process, and criticism is more than welcome. Any formatting tips would be appreciated as well.

23085715,Sort a std::vector by type,"
I was watching http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/Writing-Quick-Code-in-Cpp-Quickly and around min 36, they talk about the benefits of sorting a collection by the type of its elements if you are going to be calling virtual methods on them.

How could you sort myVector in such a way that the elements of each type are all adjecent?
Is there any way to do that without using a virtual function in order to indentify each derived type? (Maybe using typeid?)

I'm trying to sort some enums into ascending order using the sort function (sort(cards.begin(), cards.end());) but it doesn't seem to be sorting them correctly. It is returning them in the order:

22977818,BinSearch fails after Bubble Sort,"
My program seems to be behaving oddly all of a sudden and I cannot figure out why no matter how I look.
Let's begin with the header
With this set up, the program loads numbers from a database (any random combination of digits and another set of ""prices""), then we call the function to load, sort, and search the array, as found in the CPP file
However, the output runs into the following problem: where the sequential search will scour the entire database and find our value, the binSearch will only search up to 8 values and fail. At first I thought this was due to the way the sort was loaded, but once I coded it out, it continued to fail. Worse yet, aside from adding the sort, the program function just fine prior to this.
I'm running out of ideas as to where the program is wrong, as this code worked just fine up until arraySort() was added.

22950811,c++: std::map iterative ordering for numeric ids - cross-compiler,"
Quick question:
using numeric id's and STL maps, will C++ always iterate over the pairs in the order of the numeric id? Could this change depending on the compiler or is it guaranteed by the STL spec?
Example:
It doesn't matter which order I add the pairs in, they will always come out in numeric order in G++. Will this be the same across compilers?
Secondly, given the small size of the map, would it make any conceivable difference to performance if I were iterating over a std::string array[11] instead of a map? Scenario being iterating over the map 60 times per second with various other stuff going on.
EDIT: Thanks to Drino I have the answer, however testing has shown that in the case scenario where a map has fewer elements than the array, it may perform much better dependent on the number of elements. Please see the test code used below to achieve this, and apologies in advance for the SDL code, it was faster than hand-scripting my own milliseconds function in C++. Compiled using mingw, g++ 4.8, -O2:
On this machine this routinely gives the output:
num milliseconds array:14
num milliseconds map:11
Reversing the order of tests makes no difference. Removing the commented-out map insertions changes the results to the following:
num milliseconds array:14
num milliseconds map:16
So, in the scenario where the number of map elements is variable or may not reach even half the maximum amount allowed, it may make more performant sense to use map instead of array, as the overhead of iterating the map is minor when the maximum is reached, but the benefits when the maximum is not reached are greater.

22920925,Topological Sorting Algorithm not working right,"
Ok I have to do a topological sorting algorithm on a graph. I need to find the node with in degree of 0 and queue it, then print it and remove all the edges going to it. I am removing the edges by decrementing the number of edges going into it in the countList map. I have the adjacency list as a map, and the count of in degrees for each node as a map. My algorithm is only accessing the first element of the adjacency list. so my output queue is only displaying the first key of the adjacency list map. over and over. I stopped the while loop at 25 so it wouldn't be infinite.
Can someone help me with understanding why it is not iterating through the countList and is only staying on the first element? 
Thank you.
So I changed the countList.at(a)-+1, to countList.at(a)-- for proper decrementation. 
Now the output is more than just the first vertex that was 0 in degree. But the output is still wrong.  
Here is the whole thing.
My variable declarations
I don't want to put up the code for the adjacencyList or countList but here are how they look.
My output should be either:
OK I added 
countList.at(it->first)--;
after I push the vertex onto the queue. So that should decrement the count of that vertex to -1.
This narrowed my output alot. 
OK IT WORKS NOW!!!
I changed the while loop to stop after the queue is empty and printed the queue in the while loop and it fixed the problem.
My output now is: 
Ok this code will only work if the node names are only single values.
How would I change the adjList mapping for values that node names are longer than a single character?
Perhaps a linked list being pointed to by the key value? And if so how would I do that?

Using std::sort function in C++ to get the product values for std::vector. Using doubles for triple products. 
Using Radix sort in OpenCL C - converting the absolute floating values to unsigned integers and converting them back. I am using cl_float for triple products.

22897053,Quickly sort 3 values,"
I have an array of three floating-point values and I want to sort them in ascending order (although order of perhaps any sorting algorithm can be easily reversed). Calling std::sort seems like an overkill:
You could do something like:
But that seems plain ugly. Also adding and subtracting of the numbers may change value of the middle sorted element. And it does not easily work in-place.
Also interesting:
But that kind of depends on how the comparison result can be converted to an integer (probably comparison + flag load instruction). Also depends on how the compiler optimizes away comparison of each element with itself, which is not easy if you consider special floating point values. Does not work inplace either.
There could be a sorting network, but i suppose that is not optimal for sorting other than powers of two of elements. Only three elements ... seems like there should be a really easy way to do it, but maybe there is none.
What would be the minimal and at the same time fast way to sort three numbers? Readability is not a concern here.
This is kind of similar to Fastest sort of fixed length 6 int array but here I would expect some short but quick code, as sorting 3 values can likely be written in fewer lines of code than a sorting loop for arbitrary number of items.
Results:
Measured on 100 billions of numbers on Intel Core i7-2620M and Windows 7. Visual Studio 2008, release, the numbers were generated with rand(), but the time spent inside was subtracted.

22887853,Does MPI_Send send address of an array or array content,"
I am writing Mergesort with MPI to sort an array of integers. The idea is to mergesort the left half of the array on the same rank, while sending the right half of the array to a child rank. So if there are four procs, it looks like this:
The parent rank always sends the unsorted right half of array to right child, receives the sorted subarray back from right child. 
In serial mergesort algorithm, the sorting of subarray can be done on the same address of the whole array without generating temp array. Can the same thing be applied to MPI implementation with MPI_Send and MPI_Recv? My understanding is MPI_Send sends the address of the first element of the subarray 
Child process does seem to get the subarray values by doing the following:
rank 1 then will operate merge sort on received subarray elements which is stored at a different address than the original array. Is there a way to receive array address instead since it will be easier to merge the two sorted subarrays if they are in the same block (and this is what serial merge does).

edit 
Thanks to whoever answered my question (and then instantly deleted it for some reason). This is my first time implementing any kind of sort so I was just trying to figure it out logically and it obviously went poorly. 
I got close but setting y = 1 was causing redundant checking that was also reverse switching my values. Setting y = x + 1 in my 2nd for loop makes the loop ignore the values that have already been sorted. The posted solution also had x < size - 1 in my first loop since the last value doesn't need to be sorted. Hopefully those explanations are correct. Here is the new output that works.

I am fairly new to std::tuple and std::tie.  I need a way to efficiently order structs according to a left to right ordering of comparisons.  For this reason, I chose to use the std::make_tuple and std::tie types for custom ordering a StructA in the live example provided.  The tuple approach provides built in equivalence comparisons starting from left to right which is ideal for LessThanComparable element ordering for a std::sort with an accompanying lambda comparator (for which I show 3 examples).  
The problem is that as far as I am aware, std::make_tuple makes inefficient copies of the tuple elements, and I was wondering if there was some way to combine std::make_tuple with std::tie as I tried to do with my 3rd comparator - which failed (otherwise its output would look like the first output ordering).  
In my specific example I cannot use std::tie directly as I need to use a temporary as the 1st element in my tuple.

I have a data array with 2*N ints, representing pairs, that is for even i=0,2,4,...,2*N (pairs[i], pairs[i+1]) is such a pair. The data is formatted like this because I use Matlab's mex library. I do:
int N=5;
int data[10] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
struct Pair { int first; int second; };
Pair * pairs = (Pair *)data;

but the problem would be that there is no way to guarantee that Pair aligns as two sizeof(ints) in order first, second. See: Is the member field order of a class ""stable""?
I don't want to process and copy all data into a new array, since it should not be necessary, and I need (as far as I can see) to use
typedef int Pair[2];

to be sure that it aligns correctly (no trailing garbage bytes, etc). if I then want to sort the pairs according to the first element, I could do:
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>

typedef int Pair[2];

int compare(Pair n1, Pair n2) { return n1[0] < n2[0]; }

int main() {
    int N=5;
    int data[10] = {1,2, 7,8, 13,14, 4,5, 10,11};
    Pair *pairs  = (Pair *)((void *)data); 

    std::cout << ""unsorted"" << std::endl;
    for(int i=0; i<N;++i) std::cout << i << "": ("" << pairs[i][0] << "", "" << pairs[i][1] << "")"" << std::endl;

    std::sort(data, data+N, compare);

    std::cout << ""sorted"" << std::endl;
    for(int i=0; i<N;++i) std::cout << i << "": ("" << pairs[i][0] << "", "" << pairs[i][1] << "")"" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

see: http://ideone.com/VyBUvc
I could summarize the error message as error: array must be initialized with a brace-enclosed initializer, see below for the complete message. It is caused by the std::sort call.
I wrapped the Pair typedef in a union here ( http://ideone.com/TVmEeZ ), and that seems to work. Why does c++ (or std::sort) not see int[2] in a similar way as a union?

23438331,Adding all elements into a vector after the function is fully processed,"
Brief explanation: I wrote a program that implements an event-driven simulation of a bank having one teller. The program reads data from an input file of arrival and transaction times. Each line of the ﬁle contains the arrival time and required transaction time for a customer. 
My issue: If the arrival events from the input file is not sorted in ascending order, I want the program to print which customer is out of order. To do this, I created a vector and stored all of the arrival events into the vector and did this:
The problem is that the input file looks like this:

3 5 7 4 10 5 8 2 12 9

If you notice, the 4th customer in the first column is out of order.
And when the program runs, the output is:

Processing an arrival event at time:    3 The size of the vector
  is: 1 Processing an arrival event at time:    7 The size of
  the vector is: 2 Processing a departure event at time:   8
  Processing an arrival event at time:   10 The size of the vector
  is: 3 Processing an arrival event at time:    8 The size of
  the vector is: 4 The customer out of order is: 3 Processing an
  arrival event at time:   12 The size of the vector is: 5 The
  customer out of order is: 3 Processing a departure event at time: 
  12 Processing a departure event at time:  17 Processing a
  departure event at time:  19 Processing a departure event at time:
  28

If you notice, it says the customer out of order is the 3rd customer and that's because at the time that arrival event is processed, there are only 4 elements in the vector (3, 7, 10, 8). 
Is there a way to add in ALL the arrival events into the vector before checking if any of them are out of order so that the fourth customer is out of order?

My goal is to have something like the aggregate functions available in SQL, such as count() and sum() when I group by the first column.
For instance, if I have:
I would like to get:
However, I am stuck in the very first step: how do I sort the rows according to the value of the first element of each row?
I found a clue on this topic, and changed adapted the comparator to:
But the compiler was not very happy about that (making a reference to the stl_algo.h file):
I was therefore wondering if there is a way to sort such a vector of vectors when it contains doubles.

24286209,Topological sorting using std::sort,"
Note: While writing this question, I think I already found the answer. Feel free to ammend or append it with a better version. I thought it might be nice to document my problem. edit I was wrong, my aswer was not correct.
Considering a list of integer pairs: I'd like to topologically sort them based on a partial ordering. This is similar to Is partial-order, in contrast to total-order, enough to build a heap? , but I'd like to use std::sort instead of std::priority_queue.
To do so I wrote this piece of code:
Source: http://ideone.com/CxOVO0
Resulting in:
Which is pretty much topologially sorted (proof by example ;).
However, the partial ordering creates that !((1,2) < (2,1)) and !((1,2) > (2,1)) according to the tpc, and hence one may conclude (1,2) == (2,1). However, paragraph 25.4.3 of the c++ standard (January 2012 working draft) states:

For all algorithms that take Compare, there is a version that uses operator< instead. That is, comp(*i,
  *j) != false defaults to *i < *j != false. For algorithms other than those described in 25.4.3 to work
  correctly, comp has to induce a strict weak ordering on the values.

Edited: According to ecatmur 's valid answer: 
A partial ordering is not necessarily a strict weak ordering; it breaks the transitivity of incomparibility. So I'd like to drop my reasoning that a partial ordering is always a strict weak ordering and the associated questions, and add the question: am I doomed to write my own topological sorting algorithm or use the boost implementation which requires me to build the graph?
Solution: A smart suggestion of ecatmur: 
struct topological_pair_comparator {
    bool operator()(const pair &p, const pair &q) const { return (p.a + p.b) < (q.a + q.b); }
} tpc;

Not so far I've learned how std::deque is implemented under the hood, and discovered that it's something like an array of pointers to n-byte arrays, where the data is actually stored. So now I have a couple of questions related to deques.
A picture that describes my current knowledge about it's structure:
The questions are:

When a push_front operation is being performed and there is no free space in Data Block 0, a new Data Block is allocated on heap and a pointer to this freshly allocated memory is inserted into 'Map' array like in ordinary array -- in O(number_of_blocks) time, yes?
How to sort this beast? Can't imagine anything better then copy all the data into array, sort it, and then put it back. But this approach requires O(n) auxiliary memory... But! std::sort provides similar interface for sorting both std::vector and std::deque. How are different algoritms for different data structures implemented? Using a template specialization? If so, why std::list can't be sorted using std::sort?
Or, maybe, std::sort doesn't care about internal structure of this containers and just uses iterators and methods, that are similar in both std::vector and std::deque (like operator[], size(), etc)? This idea sounds reasonable and an answer to ""why can't std::sort sort std::list?"" becomes evident.
How are the sizes of data blocks being chosen? You'll say ""It's implementation dependent"", but please tell more about different implementations and motivation behind solutions.

Need clarifications here.

I am creating a map that has it's underlying implementation as a sorted vector. It will likely end up being very similar to the Boost flat map. The idea is to compromise slower inserts and deletes for faster access by having all the pairs in the map stored in contiguous memory. It is also designed to be a drop in replacement for map, having the exact same interface. There will be some issues with iterator invalidation that are different from the contract of map, but I am prepared to deal with those.

The issue I am coming up against is how to deal with const. The above code will not compile because sort is not allowed to move around the const pairs. The Boost flat map appears to just ignore the problem and drop the const qualifier, however, I want a drop in replacement so this isn't an option. How can I maintain the same interface but still allow the underlying sorted interface? If at all possible I would like to avoid const_cast.

In my case the number of elements isn't particularly big (I expect N = 10~1000), though I have to repeat this sorting many times ( ~400) as part of a bigger algorithm, and the datatype known as A is pretty big (it contains among other things an unordered_map with ~20 std::pair<uint32_t,uint32_t> in it, which is the structure preventing me to invent an ordering, and making it hard to build a hash function)

25314224,Dual pivot quicksort in face of expensive swaps,"
Moved this question over to Programmers, as it didn't seem theoretical enough for CS.
TLDR
Has anyone tested dual pivot quicksort performance with expensive-to-swap elements? It seems that in this case, it should massively underperform standard quicksort.

Backstory
Inspired by recent ""question"" here on stack overflow, I decided to go and implement non trivial versions of given sorts (introsort, quicksort with 3-way partition, median of 3 pivot selection, small block insertion sort etc).
During some research I also came upon dual pivot quicksort, which is the current implementation of quicksort in Java standard library. Generally it claims that it is always at least as good as standard quicksort, and empirical testing seemed to support it. (Which is the reason it is the current implementation.)
However, it seems that no STL implementation uses dual pivot quicksort for the quicksort phase of introsort, which made me wonder why. After more research I found this paper. It says that while dual pivot quicksort performs on average 5% less comparisons, it performs significantly more swaps. (Approximately 80% more) Obviously, since Java has only primitives and reference types, swapping is always cheap. (Even so, it uses this sort only for primitives, because it is not stable)
So I wanted to see whether someone already tested standard quicksort vs dual pivot quicksort when elements are expensive to swap and has the numbers (and possibly source) lying around, or whether I will have to test this myself.
This question is specifically about quick sort variants.

I'm looking for a way to sort a C++ map in FIFO order (First In First Out)
In FIFO, we assume that an element will be inserted at the begining, where the remove operation will be donne at the end.

{1, 4, 5, 7, 10}, but instead of {1, 4, 5, 7, 10} being the output, 
let's assume we want {0, 3, 2, 1, 4} as the output  
(as {1=a[0], 4=a[3], 5=a[2], 7=a[1], 10=a[4]} )

25217333,Splicing two different length vectors based on their respective index vectors containing global addresses to new vectors of common length with thrust,"
this problem has been on my mind for several years.  I have been learning a great deal of c++ and cuda from this forum.  Previously I wrote the following in fortran serial code with a lot of conditional statements, and using gotos because I could not find a clever way to do it.
Here is the problem.
Given 4 vectors: 
indx and indy are index vectors (keys for values dnx, dny respectively) containing global coordinates. It is unknown before parsing to this desired interlace/splice function their global ranges. All that is known is the length of the possible local range can be [0,nord*nord] and the max and min values within  the vectors indx and indy.
I want to create new vectors dn1 and dn2 of the same length containing the original values of dnx and dny but are extended to pad out the original vectors dnx and dny with zeros for all the global coordinates which they DON'T contain of the other vector.  They will form the vectors for an outerproduct which needs global addresses aligned.
I have not been able to find any reference on the web to using logical masks in c++ like in fortran to parallelise.  My starting point is to use thrust libraries stable_sort to get in ascending order, binary_search to compare the arrays, partition etc.  Perhaps there is a clear and concise way of doing this.
the example indices and value vecs below do not generally kick off from 0 or coincide with the local addressing of temporary indexing vectors, nor any even odd pattern - these values are just to help illustrate.)  
Previously I did something like the following where kernel applied the comparisons, fill-ins and flow was based on following conditions and continued back to enter again through one of these conditional lines until the largest local index exceeded length of largest vector i,e i ,  j > nshape :

Base question Please read this question, even if you don't have time to look at all the other details. :)
 - I need to store multiple objects of my custom class (Tuple) into a set. That class contains only a vector of string. (As required by the project). How do I implement this so that it recognizes each element uniquely (and therefore only eliminates identical vectors)? 2 - I was suggested by my professor that I could inherit from vector string in my custom class (Tuple) so that I wouldn't have to write my own ""operator<"" 

1 - Is this true? 
2 - If not is there something else I could use inheritance from to get this functionality?

Further Details, if you have time :)
I've looked around on the web for a bit and haven't found a solution to my problem. First off, I will admit this is a school assignment (A simple Relational Database) so I have some requirements to follow (even If I don't now see why some of these things are to be done this way).

Required Classes
--> ""Relation""
------> must use a std::set to hold Tuples
-->""Tuple""
------> is a list of ""attribute values""

I was given the hint in class that if I extended the vector of string that the I would not to write my own operator< in class ""Tuple"". I don't know that this is a kosher suggestion my professor gave, but not having to write a complicated operator< class sounds appealing to me.
The Issue:
I need to store a set of ""Tuples"" a class which I am to create. The problem I have right now is that only the first ""Tuple"" is stored. I used a vector alongside the set just so I could see if my code is trying to do what I want, and it looks like my problem is that the set is recognizing each ""Tuple"" I insert as equivalent to the already existing ""Tuple"", thus I end up with a set of only 1 ""Tuple"" even though I should have more.
I've included code that I see as relevant below. To keep you from looking at way to much stuff, at the bottom I show the function that is inserting new ""Tuples"" into an already existing ""Relation"", if you look in the Relation class you'll see the function ""insertTuple(Tuple tupIn);"" which receives a tuple and adds it to the set in question.
What I need to know?

Why is only one item being stored in the set?
How do I fix this so that all non-duplicate items are stored on the set? (given that I am not all insertions are duplicates, because they are not).

The point of the assignment is to compare these runtimes to the theoretical runtimes, but we've never discussed how to handle getting a runtime, so the most any of us can do is Google aimlessly in hopes of finding something that works.

25000418,Implementing a mutable ranking table in c++,"
In an event-driven simulator, I need to keep track of the popularity of a large number of content elements from a catalog. More specifically I am interested in knowing the rank of any given content, i.e. its position in a list sorted by descending number of requests. I know that the number of requests per content is only going to be increased by one each time, so there is no dramatic shift in the ranking. Furthermore, elements are inserted or deleted from the catalog only in rare occasions, while requests are much more numerous and frequent. What is the best data structure to implement this?
These are the options that I have considered:

a std::map<ContentElement, unsigned int> mapping contents to the number of requests they received. Not a good choice, as it requires me to dump everything to a list and sort it whenever I want to know the ranking of a content, which is very often.
a boost::multi_index_container with two indexes, a hashed_unique for the ContentElement and an ordered_not_unique for the number of requests. This allows me to quickly retrieve a content in order to update its number of requests and to keep the container sorted as I do this through a modify call, but my understanding of the ordered index is that it still forces me to iterate through all its element in order to figure the rank of a content - I could not figure a simple way of extracting the position in the ranking from the ordered iterator.
a boost::bimap between content elements and ranking position, supported by an external sorted vector storing the number of requests per content. Essentially the rank of a content would also represent the index of the vector element with its number of requests. This allows me to do everything I want to do (e.g., easily go from content to rank and viceversa) and sorting the vector after a new request should require at most two swaps in the bimap. However it feels clumsy and error-prone as I could easily loose sync between the map and the vector and then everything would fall apart. 

My guts tell me there must be a much simpler and more elegant way of handling this, but I could not find it. Can anyone help?

unordered_map<int,int> in which I just dump and sort (or search for max if that's all I need) when I need them in order.  Big downside, O(N) to get the max, O(N log(N)) to sort (presumably).

(repeat)?(elements[j] > tempElement):(elements[j] < tempElement)
It looks little bit strange and I know its not the best way to solve the problem, so I tried this:
elements[j] (reverse)?(<):(>) tempElement
But its not correct and doesn't work. Also ternary operator doubled the number of elementary operations in if statement. I know it's just an Insertion Sort that does Θ(n^2) operations (not the best way of sorting a lot of elements), but I think there is a better way to write it. Another thing is that you can't use this:
(repeat)?(-1):(1) * (elements[j] - tempElement) > 0
Because class T can have only operator= and operator> (operator<). Also you can't call function in loop, because it will be Θ(n) or Θ(n^2) calls. Here is the last solution:
The only problem is repeating code. The main principle of programming says: ""Don't repeat yourself"" (D.R.Y). I really don't know how to write code correctly here.

24650626,How to implement classic sorting algorithms in modern C++?,"
The std::sort algorithm (and its cousins std::partial_sort and std::nth_element) from the C++ Standard Library is in most implementations a complicated and hybrid amalgamation of more elementary sorting algorithms, such as selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, or heap sort.
There are many questions here and on sister sites such as https://codereview.stackexchange.com/ related to bugs, complexity and other aspects of implementations of these classic sorting algorithms. Most of the offered implementations consist of raw loops, use index manipulation and concrete types, and are generally non-trivial to analyse in terms of correctness and efficiency.
Question: how can the above mentioned classic sorting algorithms be implemented using modern C++?

no raw loops, but combining the Standard Library's algorithmic building blocks from <algorithm>
iterator interface and use of templates instead of index manipulation and concrete types
C++14 style, including the full Standard Library, as well as syntactic noise reducers such as auto, template aliases, transparent comparators and polymorphic lambdas.

Notes: 

for further references on implementations of sorting algorithms see Wikipedia, Rosetta Code or http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/ 
according to Sean Parent's conventions (slide 39), a raw loop is a for-loop longer than composition of two functions with an operator. So f(g(x)); or f(x); g(x); or f(x) + g(x); are not raw loops, and neither are the loops in selection_sort and insertion_sort below.
I follow Scott Meyers's terminology to denote the current C++1y already as C++14, and to denote C++98 and C++03 both as C++98, so don't flame me for that.
As suggested in the comments by @Mehrdad, I provide four implementations as a Live Example at the end of the answer: C++14, C++11, C++98 and Boost and C++98. 
The answer itself is presented in terms of C++14 only. Where relevant, I denote the syntactic and library differences where the various language versions differ.

24441333,iterating over an STL container using element keys,"
I need some help with choosing an efficient algorithm to put elements from a vector into presorted buckets - or ideally output iterator ranges (as they are efficient I think).  The example below is totally contrived, but the idea is that a an element's key is used to determine the output bucket.  I'm not asking how to sort in order as that is a very simple matter of simply calling (which works and reorders the elements according to the key)
I put a live example on coliru, where it is very easy to modify and fix (well not that easy or I wouldn't be asking the question). I could also go through the elements in this sorted list and while the key value is the same, append it into a new bucket, but I am looking for something more STL like in nature, and right now the above smells like a bit of a last resort hack, also the final solution needs to be efficient as the testVec is potentially large and the objects are also big in size.  I would prefer not to modify the testvec - so it should be immutable.
Ideally I am looking for some sort of construct that spits out range iterators or something equally efficient.  The actual objects are large so passing references or moving them is really the only option - my actual objects (the equivalent to MyStr) are movable.  Something sort of foreach key, apply key predicate or something which I cannot figure out is what I am looking for.  I hard coded the 3 buckets below just to show what I need to be able to attain - this is totally a hack.

25965661,Comparison with passing criteria as template parameter to sort() results in less overhead than passing criteria function pointer to qsort()?,"
In Stroustrup's The C++ programming language , Page 431, when he was discussing about the design of the standard libraries, he said,  

For example, building the comparison criteria into a sort function is unacceptable because the same
  data can be sorted according to different criteria.  This is why the C standard library qsort() takes a comparison function as an argument rather than relying on something fixed, say, the < operator.  On the other hand, the overhead imposed by a function call for each comparison compromises qsort() as a building block for further library building.

These above make sense to me. But in the second paragraph, he said,  

Is that overhead serious?  In most cases, probably not.  However, the function call overhead can
  dominate the execution time for some algorithms and cause users to seek alternatives.  The technique of supplying comparison criteria through a template argument described in §13.4 solves that
  problem.   

In §13.4, the comparison criteria are defined as class with static member functions (which does the comparison). When these classes are used as template parameters, the comparison is still done by their static member functions. It seems to me  there would still be overheads for calling the static member function. 
What did Stroustrup mean by saying that?

With this card class,
I'm trying to implement a method for the deck class that uses selection sort to sort the array.
This is my code for my method sort(), declared and defined within the deck class:
However, when I call it on a deck object d, nothing seems to happen. I've written some other methods that shuffle the deck or cut the deck and swap each half, both of which work, but when I call sort(), nothing happens. I've been checking the array through a printCards() method and it changes when I call shuffle() or cut(), but stays the same as the previous printout after I call sort().
In main():
Printout after debugging:
I don't have much of an idea as to why nothing seems to happen to the array, considering I've successfully implemented selection sort for other projects involving arrays and classes. The only new-ish thing I'm doing here is sorting an array of objects with multiple variables, but I'm pretty sure I'm comparing the proper variable between each card in sort().

I want to keep a sorted queue of items, where I want to be able to pop the item with the lowest value (a bit like std::priority_queue). The item values are contiguous and ever increasing.

25549048,Why `std::sort` tries to compare values that are not in the input list?,"
I am using the method explained here How to obtain the index permutation after the sorting in order to find the index permutation that sorts the elements of an array.
Strangely enough, I get segmentation faults in some cases. Tracing back the problem, I found out that the std::sort tries to call the comparator with indices outside the valid range. I am sure that always before calling the std::sort, the index array is filled with correct indices (i.e. 0 to data.size()-1).
It might be interesting to note that in my case, data has always a length of 32 and I realize that the comparator is called with first argument 145 (and the second is always something in range of 0 to 31). 
Any idea why this could happen?

I tried solving this interview question. My code runs for  test cases  but  fails for all the  real  input test cases. I tried hard to find the mistake but unable to do so. Please find my code below the question

Bob loves sorting very much. He is always thinking of new ways to sort an array.His friend Ram gives him a challenging task. He gives Bob an array and an integer K. The challenge is to produce the lexicographical minimal array after at most K-swaps. Only consecutive pairs of elements can be swapped. Help Bob in returning the lexicographical minimal array possible after at most K-swaps. 
Input: The first line contains an integer T i.e. the number of Test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case has 2 lines. The first line contains N(number of elements in array) and K(number of swaps). The second line contains n integers of the array. 
Output: Print the lexicographical minimal array. 
Constraints:

When sorting a container of objects having an explicit copy ctor I get compiler errors (from g++ 4.8.2 and clang++ 3.4, both in -std=c++11 mode) that I don't understand. I've created a simple example to demonstrate the problem
This fails with

The code also compiles after removing the call to std::sort (so is_less(objects[1], objects[2]) is not a problem). Hence my question is what std::sort does when calling the comparing function that makes compiling this code fail and how to fix it.
After a lot of research, the only question that came close to my problem is In copy-initialization, is the call to the copy constructor explicit or implicit? which links to a bug in gcc. However, clang shows the same behavior, so I'd really like to understand what's going on.

25516540,Rearrange list the same way as another one,"
I bumped into a page where there were a lot of categories and next to each one the number of items in each category, wrapped in parenthesis. Something really common. It looked like this:
So I was curious and I wanted to see which categories had more items and such, and since all categories were all together in the page I could just select them all and copy them in a text file, making things really easy.
I made a little program that reads all the numbers, store them in a list and sort them. In order to know what category the number it belonged to I would just Ctrl + F the number in the browser.
But I thought it would be nice to have the name of the category next to the number in my text file, and I managed to parse them in another file. However, they are not ordered, obviously.
This is what I could do so far:
Now I forget about having the name next to the number, because something more interesting occured to me. I thought it would be interesting to find a way to rearrange the strings in the text_list which contain the names of the categories in the exact same way the list with the item count was sorted.
Let me explain with an example, lets say we have the following categories:
The way I'm doing it I will have a list<int> containing this: {10, 6, 5, 3} and a list<string> containing this: {A, B, C, D}.
What I'm saying is I want to find a way I can keep track of the way the elements were rearranged in the first list and apply that very pattern to the second list. What would be the rearrange pattern? It would be: the first item (5) goes to the third position, the second one (3) to the fourth one, the third one (10) to the first one, and so on.... Then this pattern should be applied to the other list, so that it would end up like this: {C, D, A, B}.

The thing would be to keep track of the Pattern and apply it to the list below.
Is there any way I can do this? Any particular function that could help me? Any way to track all the swaps and switches the sort algorithm does so it can be applied to a different list with the same size? What about a different sorting algorithm?
I know this might be highly inefficient and a bad idea, but it seemed like a little challenge.
I also know I could just pair both string and int, category and item count, in some sort of container like pair or map or make a container class of my own and sort the items based on the item count (I guess map would be the best choice, what do you think?), but this is not what I am asking.

To improve the performance, maybe the min-heap can be used instead of vec_pos in my codes above. And the variable max_val holds the current max value of all vectors. So just compare the root value with max_val, if they are same, this element can be put into intersection list.

A predicate to compare the distances is easy, but I don't understand how to shift the elements around.

EDIT for more information: Here's an example, making a circle then arbitrarily taking one point and making it the smallest. Like center, radius is an in-class variable, and should be assumed to be a valid float.

I just had my first contact with std::vector and now I want to change my bad habit of using plain C-style arrays. I found that std::list is the container to use when it comes to sorting. However, I am not 100% how to accomplish the following:
I am doing some calculations whose outcome depends on two indices (i and j). In the end I am only interested in the 100 smallest results (not necessarily 100, but for sure much smaller than my total number of calculated values, m*n in the below code). 
After completion, value_list should contain the 100 smallest values (increasing order) and i_list / j_list the corresponding indices. I have a working version of the ""insertValuesAndIndices()"", but there I use plain arrays and the most inefficient way of inserting new values. While writing I realize that i actually have 2 distinct questions:

The number of computed values (m*n) is by far bigger than the number I want to keep in the list, thus simply keeping all values and sorting only once in the end is not really an option. On the other hand, I need the results in the right order only in the end, so maybe there is a way of sorting the list only once. Is there any ""standard"" clever and efficient way do to this kind of sorting?
Even if I could store all results and do the sorting afterwards, I am not sure how to use the std::list.sort() to get the arrays of indices in the right order. What came to my mind is to define some class containing the result and the two indices, put those elements in a list and then use a comparator that checks only the value to do the sorting. However, maybe there is a more straightforward way to do the same?

First student's details are asked by user input and others are initialized by variables. Everything goes fine untill I have to sort them out. 
At the moment I'm trying to pass an array to a sorting function, containing each students details which I entered manually to that array for testing purposes. I had some serious problems when I tried to initialize array directly from struct member values and then passing that array to sorting func. Also, in this exercise I must use C-arrays.
Perpaps someone can show me proper way of doing this? Maybe there is even easier way to do this? Thanks in advance! Here is my code:

26371682,Original Code used Int Arrays. Need to change to Vector Arrays,"
TL;DR: Help me pass vector array input into a function that originally took in int pointers and ints.
I am in a college class that is learning about well-known algorithms. In this class, we use C++ to code the given algorithms. There was no pre-req class to learn C++, so my knowledge is pretty low when it comes to some of the major stuff with programming.
My problem: I have to create a program that takes an input file, sorts it with the user's choice of sorting algorithm, and write the results to an output file. My original code that works perfectly uses an input file of 20 items, placed into an array of length 20, and sorts no problem with each individual sorting algorithm.
Since last night, the only thing I have changed is that my input goes to a vector array, since the teacher will give us files of varying length (10 items to 1,000,000 items). I have four sorting algorithms that need to sort these given input files. Only one of them works, and it does not pass any variables into the function.
The other 3 originally passed in array pointers and other variables, however they do not work with my new input now going to a vector array instead of an int array. I know that what I am passing in needs to be changed, but I have no idea how to do this correctly. I have tried many different ways from sources found on the internet (with pointers and references), but I have had no luck. Here is some snipets of the code I'm using.
Last thing. I do not get an error when trying to run the Merge-Sort. It just freezes my console window.

I am trying to be as time-efficient as possible, so I want to avoid setting said random position to 0 or something like that.
So if my array looked something like int n[] = {1,3,5,7,9}; and my random position finder chose position 2, how would I move 5(position 2) to the end and shift everything down so that my resulting array looks like {1,3,7,9,5} ?

26320422,How does selection sort work?,"
This is a selection sort that I'm trying and I don't understand why it isn't working.  My understanding is that selection sort scans a vector for the smallest value which when it finds it moves it to the beginning of the vector.  It preforms another scan this time ignoring the first element and doing it all over again until  n - 1 times where n is the length of the vector.
EDIT: posted whole program
So the issue is it doesn't sort at all, just gives back vName unsorted.

26174475,"C++ Linked List Sorting, Splitting, and Printing issue","
Hi guys for my lab assignment this week I was assigned to learn about Linked Lists. The lab prompt is as follows: 

Write a program that creates a forward linked list of at least 20 elements, where each element holds a random integer between 0 and 99. Print the list.
Write the function ""returnMiddleList"" to find the middle element of the linked list in one pass. Print the integer value of this element and the position of this element (starting at zero) in relation to the head (where the head = 0, the element pointed to by the head = 1, the element pointed to by the previous one = 2, etc).
Split the list in half at the middle element to create two entirely separate* linked lists of near equal size (+/- 1) and print the two lists. Modify the ""returnMiddleList"" function to accomplish this, returning the head of the second linked list and setting the link of the element pointing to that head to null. Then print the two sums of the integers stored in the elements of both lists.
Sort the two lists from least to greatest and print them out (printing at this step is optional depending on the sort approach taken). Then combine the two lists while sorting them again from least to greatest and print out the new list. (HINT: you can subdivide the lists further and sort them on a scale of one to two element lists before sorting and combining the first two unsorted lists. What is this sort called?)

I have got #1 and #2 working, but #3 and #4 is where the issue is beginning. When I split my link list into two lists and print the individual lists out, my first link list prints out 9 numbers when it should be printing out 10 (the 10th number somehow disappears?), but when I do the sum of the first list right after that, the number that has disappeared gets added in the sum! I do not know why it is disappearing, and this is one issue. Another issue is in the second list, a random ""0"" gets added to the list and one of the numbers is lost. My last issue is about #4 as the merge algorithm I have used does not seem to work (I am merging the list together while sorting them, but I am not using a recursion sort because we have not learned that yet). Any input and help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

26151288,"Reading integers from a file with mixed integers, letters, and spaces C++","
This is a sort of self-imposed extra credit problem I'm adding to my current programming assignment which I finished a week early. The assignment involved reading in integers from a file with multiple integers per line, each separated by a space. This was achieved easily using while(inFile >> val) .
The challenge I put myself up to was to try and read integers from a file of mixed numbers and letters, pulling out all contiguous digits as separate integers composed of those digits. For examples if I was reading in the following line from a text file:
12f 356 48 r56 fs6879 57g 132e efw ddf312 323f
The values that would be read in (and stored) would be
12f 356 48 r56 fs6879 57g 132e efw ddf312 323f
or 
12, 356, 48, 56, 6879, 57, 132, 312, and 323
I've spent all afternoon digging through cplusplus.com and reading cover to cover the specifics of get, getline, cin etc. and I am unable to find an elegant solution for this. Every method I can deduce involves exhaustive reading in and storing of each character from the entire file into a container of some sort and then going through one element at a time and pulling out each digit.
My question is if there is a way to do this during the process of reading them in from a file; ie does the functionality of get, getline, cin and company support that complex of an operation?

+Problem: When doing the Binary search, only the middle element consistently comes out correct. The other elements, when searched for, provide blank space instead of a number. Picture: http://i.imgur.com/7JOoCwk.png
Assignment information: Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number of elements and the
numbers themselves to be placed in an integer array that holds a maximum of 50
elements. The program should then prompt the user for an integer which will be
searched for in the array using a binary search. Make sure to include the following
steps along the way:
1) A sort routine must be called before the binary search. You may use either
the selection sort or the bubble sort. However, the sort must be implemented
in its own function and not in main.
2) Next include a function called by main to implement the binary search.
The ordered array produced by the sort should be passed to the search
routine which returns the location in the sorted array of the sought value,
or -1 if the value is not in the array.
3) Add a value returning function that computes the mean of your data set.
Recall that the mean is the sum of the data values divided by the number
of pieces of data. Your program should output the size of the array
entered, the array as entered by the user, the sorted array, the integer
being searched for, the location of that integer in the sorted array (or an
appropriate message if it is not in the array), and the mean of the data set.

I have the cout there as a test to see if my vectors were indeed sorted. So far no luck. I am suspecting I'm losing reference at some point, but I'm not sure where... or I might messed something up in my syntax with all these long dot-notation returns...
For additional context, the sortTicket(LotteryTicket&) function is invoked from within the function that checks if a ticket is a bronze winner. That mentioned function receives the ticket argument from a different function... i.e. a long chain of passing the argument, all with a call by reference (I can paste more code if needed.)

27100192,"Which is faster, sorting a vector, then putting it into an AVL tree, or inputting it directly?","
So here's the situation:
I have millions, possibly billions, of strings that I am trying to parse and put into a sorted structure, lets say I have 5,000,000 strings.
I'm trying to write a fast program that can put all of these strings from an unsorted vector into an ordered data structure that can also search the structure fast, thus the reasoning for the AVL tree (which eventually I plan to use a hash table of a-z for even faster lookup, but that comes later). I get all of the strings into a vector first, but they are all jumbled up, unsorted and different lengths. 
I don't want any repeated strings in my tree, so if the program finds the strings ""hello"" and ""hello"" it would only have one AVL entry and would  increment an integer holder for the frequency that this string has appeared. 
So my question is this: would it be faster to sort the vector first (using something fast like a multi-threaded quicksort or something else) and then input it into the AVL tree, after all the words are sorted together with other same words, OR is it faster to just put all the data from the unsorted vector into the AVL tree, and continously checking the AVL tree for whether or not a word already exists, then incrementing it.
So to picture it in an order of operations here are the two cases:


Which case is faster??
--EDIT-- So after hearing some of the comments, inserting a sorted array into an AVL tree from the beginning would be a bad idea, which makes sense due to how many rotations would be made. It seems that directly inserting into the AVL tree is probably a good idea, but what is the best way to efficiently insert when a word is already in the tree somewhere? How can I make sure that I find it? Is that where my sorting can come in?

27086267,Merge sort variant: using link array,"
I was looking for the variants of Merge Sort. So my textbook says, 
A variant of function Merge in which No records need to be moved at all, can be implemented by use of an auxiliary array links.
Firstly, I would like to state the code. 
Okay so what I understood of the algorithm is:

If the number of elements are less than 15, apply insertion sort and sort those elements.
This way, we will get many lists that will be sorted by themselves but the entire array will not be sorted as such. 
To sort the entire array, the function Merge is used. 

My question is, 
How is the function Merge combining the different sorted lists to one sorted list? I dont have any idea of the concept of the link array.
I am sorry but I tried very hard to understand but I dont get how the output array is ""sorted"" ?

27049072,Sorting a pair of vectors,"
I know how to sort a vector of pairs, but how do you sort a pair of vectors? I can think of writing a custom ""virtual"" iterator over a pair of vectors and sorting that, but that seems quite complex. Is there an easier way? Is there one in C++03? I would like to use std::sort.
This problem arises when processing some data generated in hardware, where a pair of arrays makes more sense than array of pairs (since then there would be all kinds of stride and alignment problems). I realize that otherwise keeping a pair of vector instead of a vector of pairs would be a design flaw (the structure of arrays problem). I'm looking for a fast solution, copying the data to a vector of pairs and then back (I will return it to the HW to do more processing) is not an option.
Example:
and after sorting (by the first vector):
I refer to a ""pair of vectors"" as the pair of keys and values (stored as e.g. std::pair<std::vector<size_t>, std::vector<double> >). The vectors have the same length.

27004457,Measuring runtime with counter variable,"
I am currently working on an assignment which asks us to implement a few different sorts and introduce counter variables to measure the runtime.
My question is that I'm confused about whether or not to include certain ""operations"" as something that would increment my counter. For instance, my textbook says this:

    ....
So, from what I understand, I should be counting ""comparisons"" but I do not understand if this applies to if statements, while loops, etc. 
For instance, here is my insertion sort.
As you can see, I increment count by 4 for each iteration of the while loop. This really highlights my question, I think. 
My reasoning is that we make two comparisons in the conditional statement of the while loop:
(loc > 0 && theArray[loc - 1] > nextItem)
Afterwards, we make two moves in the array. From my understanding, this means that we have performed 4 ""operations"" and we would increment counter by 4 for the sake of measuring runtime at the end of execution.
Is this correct? Thank you SO much for any help.

So I'm doing some homework for CompSci 2 and the assignment requires us to sort a single stack (of five numbers) in ascending order using only 3 stacks - much like a Tower of Hanoi problem - but there are no rules on whether a larger can be placed on a smaller number, etc.
I'm essentially trying to figure out a process on how to sort any number against another in the stack, but I'm at a bit of a loss - in trying to formulate an idea I came up with this: I could pop the top number off the stack, place it in another stack (say, stack 3), compare it to the next number in the original stack, and if it's less than it, I would put the number in stack 3 into stack 2.  But then I ran into the problem of order - if the number is less than the one after it, but isn't less than another number in the stack, my final result would be out of order.

I know that the root of the problem is in my swapUp() function (swapping the positioning of two nodes based on their priority), because the list works great up until it is called. The seg fault is not actually being caused by swapUp(), it's being caused by peekAt(), which returns the element in the node at position n. But the error does not occur unless swapUp() is called first, so that is where the issue is (I think). 
There is also a seg fault being caused in the destructor, which I believe may have the same root cause in swapUp().

This question already has an answer here:


Under what circumstances are linked lists useful?

                    15 answers
                



I've been spending a lot of time going back and forth on whether I should use a vector or a linked list. I've been reading many completely contradicting views on the topic, so I'd like a strait up answer based on TODAY'S hardware in the REAL world.
So I've been told that if you are doing a lot of insertion and deletion in the middle of your sequence, a linked list would be ideal, with a complexity of O(1) (which in itself I don't fully understand, since you have to traverse all the way to the desired location anyway) while insertion into a vector is apparently very slow, with a complexity of O(n)
On the other hand, after watching this lecture by Bjarne Stroustrup https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo it seems as though there is no real use for linked lists, and using linked lists because there will be a lot of insertion and deletion would really only be implemented by a naive student. What I got from this is that essentially by the nature of the traverse of a linked list it is performing random access several times as it travels through different locations in memory, while a vector performs random access once, sending you directly to the desired location. Is this Interpretation accurate?
In my implementation, the sequence is to maintain order, being updated with new values for each element every frame, hence, a lot of deletion and insertion.
My question is:
is there really any use for a linked list anymore? Even if it is to maintain order and than simply be run strait through?
background info:

the sequence is for a 2D sweep and prune broad phase collision detection;
the upper bound of number of elements in the sequence would be about 30,000

This question already has an answer here:


How to find a duplicate element in an array of shuffled consecutive integers?

                    19 answers
                



This is kind of  related to this question, but  a little tweaked .
We are given an array containing integers between 1 and 1000.
Every integer from 1 and 1000 is in the array once, but one is in the array twice. (i.e. I remove a unique element from the list and introduce a duplicate element which is already in the list,remember the size of the array is still 1000)

Determine which integer is in the array twice 
Can you do it while iterating through the array only once?

In the link that i have posted it's a different question altogether. 
My Solution:

sorting the array and then finding if the two elements are together. (avg case O(nlog(n)))
Create a bit-array  with a 1000 bits (won't take much memory). with 0 stored in each of the bit field. Iterate through the array of 1000 elements and flip the bit sign in the bit-array's index with the value of the array .

i.e. (if the 0th position of the array stores the value 548, we flip the 548th bit in the bit-array to 1).
The field with already flipped as 1 will be the repeated element
Solution2 iterates the array only once. 
Now, I was reading about the 'Telescoping series', i haven't understood it fully. but is there a concept in there (or in discrete math) where we can just sum something and subtract with something else to get the duplicate number?

The program itself is very simple: I ask the user for the array's size and then the elements. Then I want to sort the elements in ascending order but the problem is, the output isn't quite what I expect.
So when a user enters something like [4,2,1,3], instead of printing [1,2,3,4], I see [1,1,2,3]!

I'm writing a function to sort a vector of class pointers. Before sorting, the vector contains the following pointers:
After sorting, it contains these:
The following is my code:
The code runs on a dependency graph which contains a vector of DNode* objects. I'm returning this vector of pointers and sorting each node by it's DFN field. The DNode class contains Operation* objects, some boolean flags, and an int value for computing the depth first numbering of the dependency graph. The addresses shown in the first line are a result of a gdb print operations call right before the std::sort call. The addresses in the second line are a print operations call right after std::sort.
I've tried a couple more debugging steps, but still can't reconcile this error. Returning the vector of DNode* creates a desired copy of this vector which is stored in a separate address, so that modifying this new vector (such as by adding more DNodes) does not modify the actual vector in the graph class. This shouldn't cause any problems as the vector still contains each DNode*.

I was trying to write a program that uses fstream to read and write integers from a text file, but after the program is executed and exited from, the file does not change at all, and the contents remain the same.
Here's a short description of what my file is supposed to do:

This application reads a file, modifies its content, and writes the modification back to the same file. 
The file includes 3 lines of integers. The first line indicates the number of integers on the third line. The second line indicates which integer on the third line has been selected (active). 
The third line in the file lists all the integers (maximum of 10).
A menu that is constantly displayed on the screen. Right below the menu, the program displays all the integers in the third line of the file
The program also displays which integer is currently selected (active).
The user can select a menu item by pressing one of the extended keys from the menu
Pressing “Insert” will insert an integer before the selected integer and makes the newly inserted integer active. The integer is typed by the user. If the list is full, insertion will not be possible.
Pressing “Delete” deletes the active integer.
Pressing “Sort” sorts the list in ascending order. The active integer after the sort is same as the active integer before the sort.
Pressing “Select” selects the next integer in the list. If the last integer is selected, this option selects the first item in the list.
Pressing “Move right” moves the selected integer one position to the right. If the last integer is selected, moving right will not be possible.
Pressing “Move left” moves the selected integer one position to the left. If the first integer is selected, moving left will not be possible.
Pressing “Exit” ends the application.
The program saves the content of the file into an array, modifies the array, and writes back the content of the array into the file.

I have a function that reads the files in a folder (I am using boost for that). I am also trying to keep only 2 files (they are files of logs, so they are rotated, and I do not want to keep old logs = logs in the third file). I store the files' names in a list, but because the read is not done in the creation time order, I need to sort the list.
I know that

Vectors are good at:

Accessing individual elements by their position index (constant time).
Iterating over the elements in any order (linear time).
Add and remove elements from its end (constant amortized time).


and 

Advantages to list containers:

Efficient insertion and removal of elements anywhere in the container
  (constant time).
Efficient moving elements and block of elements within the container or even between different containers (constant time).
Iterating over the elements in forward or reverse order (linear time).



I am not sure what is the best way to do this: using list or vector?
Shall I

use vector and sort it ascending, delete from the end, add new element (at the end), reorder, etc;
or
use list and sort ascending it, delete from the beginning, add new element at the end, resort, etc;



Is sorting needed only at the beginning, because every file name that I insert is the last created?
If the list/vector is sorted, what is the time of resorting it?
If I use std::is_sorted is it ok for not sorting every time?


Some more info:
Because the file rotation of boost has no ""remove file if too many"" state, only the ""there is enough space on disk"", I have implemented this step of keeping the last two files, or removing the oldest every time a new one is created and there are 2 logs files. So every time a new log file is created I am verifying the list of files, and if there are enough (2 or more) just delete the older one(s). Because the names of the files are logs_%N.log, I cannot know if the file logs_X1.log is older than logs_X2.log

eg: I restart the applications, there are the files logs_51.log, logs_52.log, which one is going to be deleted? Supposing it is going to delete logs_51.log and create logs_0.log, if I restart it again, there will be logs_52.log and logs_0.log. Which one is going to be deleted now?)

That is why I need the sort, because the application may restart, and I read the existing files, completes the one that has more space and then create a new one.

Also, manually checking the positions of the first numbers corresponding to the second numbers will take O(n^2) time. I want to do it in O(n log n). Does anyone have any suggestions? Is there any built in method for this (C++ 4.3.2 / 4.8.1)?
Thanks in advance.

I am using std::nth_element to get a (roughly correct) value for a percentile of a vector, like so:
I noticed that for vectorIn lengths of up to 32 elements, the vector gets completely sorted. Starting from 33 elements it is never sorted (as expected).

28520720,C++ parallel sort,"
I need to sort data blocks which are stored in an array of structures. Structures have no pointers. Each block has its counter number and coordinates of the place in an array where the data block equal to the structure block is. For example if we have a data array which we can divide in 4 blocks of NxN, we have 4 structure blocks in index array of structure blocks and each of them has its own number and position in data array with the help of which we can compute the pointer of the block in data array using index block. Sorting should be done with the comparer that compares two blocks in such way that the least of two blocks shold have least i-th number of data. For example comparer:
where a and b are pointers to the blocks of data array which we can get due to index array and pointer of the start of data array.
Sorting shouldn't sort data array but index array.

Write a main method that declares two arrays of 100 ints, generates 100 random integers (you don't need to limit the range), storing each random number in both arrays, so that you end up with two identical arrays.  Pass one of them to the modified bubble sort and print out the return value, then pass the other array to the modified selection sort and print out the return value (label your outputs of course - the specifics of the output format are up to you as long as they are clear).

28263062,Topological sorting of C++ data structures,"
Before I start, I first have to mention that with the term ""graph"" I'll refer to an image displaying a structure. Due to my visual impairment, I can neither imagine nor draw them. I can look at them and understand - but I have a difficult time making them up myself.
I am working on a build tool that uses a scripting language to generate targets, which are processed and split into tasks. A task is represented as a data structure: https://github.com/IngwiePhoenix/IceTea/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L98
As you can see, the Task class takes note of it is a master (the actual result of the process) and stores a reference - note, one reference only, not an array - to its child and parent - if any.
So far I am able to fill the task queue with all required tasks and send it into the executor void Run(void*): https://github.com/IngwiePhoenix/IceTea/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L1107
But here come the problems:

The tasks are not properly sorted, and the build will become a mess if a previous build is canceled and then started again. If you have a.cpp and b.cpp and your last build terminated at either of the two while the other is not build, it will result in the parent task being ran twice. A proper sorting mechanism - a topological one - would very likely solve this. For now, I have classified this as a non-existent dependency tracking.
When one target depends on another, then the target depending on the other may end up being in the queue before the one it depends on. Imagine that you have libfoo.a and bar.exe. It can happen, that the task to compile bar.exe is before the one that creates libfoo.a. That means, that we'd run into a linking error.

Currently, the program is structured with a thread pool that pulls tasks from the queue and runs them. But after I have investigated more into the Ninja tool, this logic might change; there will be a thread pool that only executes commands generated from the scripting language. However, this has to wait, for now. Therefore, I am making the tool run on a single thread only, to simulate the behavior that I actually want; one command running after another.
The problem that I am mainly facing though, stays to be the sorting mechanism. From my studies on build tools, they tend to use what's called a DAG and topological sorting. Now, neither could I find a good explanation on how to write a topological sorting algorithm nor did I figure out how it works at all. I know that there are the constants u and v. But I am unable to find a way to implement it.
So far, I have understood that it is a linear graph. Let's assume the following structure:
This is very straight forward. There is one result, and one dependency. But what if we have two results depending on the same libfoo?
And that is where I am already stuck at.
Can you maybe explain to me how to implement a topological algorithm, and what a DAG actually is? It would be really helpful, because I am very honestly hitting a barrier here that is hard to overcome. Thank you in advance!
A side-note: I want to keep the tool as small as I can, therefore I can not add stuff like Boost.Graph, which I have seen as a search result.

I have a struct called count declared called count with two things in it, an int called frequency and a string called word. To simplify, my program takes in a book as a text file and I count how many times each word appears. I have an array of structs and I have my program to where it will count each time a word appears and now I want a faster way to sort the array by top frequency than the way I have below. I used the bubble sorting algorithm below but it is taking my code way too long to run using this method.  Any other suggestions or help would be welcome!! I have looked up sort from the algorithm library but don't understand how I would use it here. I am new to c++ so lots of explanation on how to use sort would help a lot.

29159099,Trouble implementing merge sort on doubly-linked list in C++,"
(FYI, first ever post to StackOverflow)
I am trying to implement a merge sort for doubly-linked lists in C++.  While the sort does work, it's not rebuilding the list properly.  It seems to be coming out as a singly-linked list with no ""previous"" pointers; the list can be read forward, but when I try to display it backwards, only the last node is shown.  I think something must be wrong with the ""merge"" routine but I can't find where it is.
To start, here is the code for the doubly-linked node of which the list is made:
Here is the doubly-linked list class, stripped down to only those functions needed to build up a list and sort it:  (FYI, this follows the algorithm presented in  ""C++ Programming:  Program Design Including Data Structures"", 6th ed. by D.S. Malik)
Here is a driver program to test it:
If you can run this, you'll see that the sorted list is shown properly by displayForwards, but not shown in reverse by displayBackwards.
I hope I've provided enough information for help!  I guess something must be wrong with the part of the merge step where the backwards link is made, I just don't see it!
cheers, and thanks in advance!

29158968,The description about sorting in Model/View Qt document maybe wrong?,"
In Qt document online Model/View Programming, it's said that If your model is sortable, i.e, if it reimplements the QAbstractItemModel::sort() function, both QTableView and QTreeView provide an API that allows you to sort your model data programmatically. In addition, you can enable interactive sorting (i.e. allowing the users to sort the data by clicking the view's headers), by connecting the QHeaderView::sortIndicatorChanged() signal to the QTableView::sortByColumn() slot or the QTreeView::sortByColumn() slot, respectively.
However, firstly the QTableView::sortByColumn() is not a slot, so one cannot connect a signal to it; secondly, the code of QTableView::sortByColumn() is something like
and QHeaderView::setSortIndicator() function emit sortIndicatorChanged(logicalIndex, order). But if one uses function setSortingEnabled(true), the signal sortIndicatorChanged(logicalIndex, order) can also be emitted automatically by the view header when click the header column of the view.
So maybe the right way is to make a slot to receive the signal sortIndicatorChanged(logicalIndex, order) and in the slot, call the override virtual function sort() of the model?

29131785,Sorting container of tuples by fixed components,"
Given a container of pairs or tuples, we want to sort it by specifying a binary predicate and a fixed component, so that the sorting focusses only on that component of each tuple.  This working code illustrates this:
The challenge now are the ties (tuples that are tied in that specified component).  So let us put into sortByFixedComponent the packs Z<Is...> and P<BinaryPredicates...> that will determine the sorting among the ties.  In the above example, there are ties, so go to the next int in Is... and the next binary predicate in BinaryPredicates... and sort among those ties in this new fixed component and new binary predicate.  If there are ties still after this, then keep going through Is... and BinaryPredicates....  This should ultimately lead to a unique ordering.
Of course, this recursion is where I'm stuck.  This is what I have so far, which compiles only because I didn't fill in the recursion step yet:
Ultimately, in main() I want the line 
to work.  It is to sort the container 
so that the char components are first looked at (sort the tuples so that the these are in alphabetical order), then among the ties look at the int component (sort the ties so that these are in reverse order), then if there are still any ties look at the string component (sort the ties so that the strings are from shortest to longest).
  Any help would be appreciated.  This question arose when I solved the first example, but then wondered about the ties.
To see a concrete example.  In my very first example, the output is (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (6, 8) because the first components are sorted from least to greatest. But 4 pairs begin with 3. So let's sort these 4 according to the second component by some other comparator. The goal is a generalization of this.
Update:
   I think the key to solving this is not recursion, so basically my attempt above can be scrapped.  I think it is composition of the binary predicates that is needed.  So my new starting point is to use this helper struct:

28993556,sort a pair by common top and bottom,"
Imagine that you have n sets of elements in a tuple. For example the tuple could be
So maybe there is some template that represents ""topbottomthings""
The point is that what is in the tuple has a notion of a top and a bottom. My question is, I need a function that returns an 
where the items in the return value 
are arranged so that each consecutive entry's TopBottomThing, the bottom of std::vector<n> matches the top of std::vector<n + 1>, matches the bottom of std::vector<n + 2> etc, or the top of std::vector<n> matches the top of std::vector<n + 1>, or the bottom of std::vector<n> matches the bottom of std::vector<n + 1>. Only one case is guaranteed to happen as a constraint to the function. If the length of the input vector is n, either 0 matches or n - 1 matches are guaranteed.
For example, if std::vector<std::tuple<TopBottomThing>> tup represents standard fractions:
2/3 4/5 3/2,
ArrangeTopBottomThingFunc with that std::vector<tup> as input would return a sorted by this criterion an std::vector like this:
[0] = 3/2 [1] = 2/3 [2] = 4/5 (two matches top/bottom)
of if std::tuple tup had these fractions:
4/7 3/2 1/2
[0] = 3/2 [1] = 1/2 [2] = 4/7 (two matches bottom/bottom)
or 
4/5 7/8 4/6
[0] 4/5 [1] = 4/6 [2] = 7/8 (two matches top/top)
or the degenerate case
4/5 6/3 2/7 (no matches)
would return in the order given.
or say std::tuple tup represents strings like this
""Straberry/Banana"" ""Blueberry/Kiwi"" ""Kiwi/Banana""
[0] = ""Kiwi/Banana"" [1] = ""Straberry/Banana"" [2] = ""Blueberry/Kiwi""
At least two of the three (n) top or bottom are guaranteed to match. It would be great if the algorithm worked for any length of
It simply sorts and returns an std::vector those things whose top/top or bottom/bottom or top/bottom match in ascending order. The rest that don't match in this way are simply added in any order.

28949538,make_heap vs priority_queue efficiency when needed once per frame,"
I tried to find information about this particular use, but I could not.
In a simulation software (that acts like a video game), I'm building an event manager that prioritize the events based on a value submitted by the event creator. The event queue will be parsed once per frame and all the events within will be processed, so each new frame starts with an empty queue. 
Now I have two options to store the events and have them prioritized:

Use a std::priority_queue, which will keep the list/vector/container prioritized at all time, then simply parse it when it's time;
Use a non-prioritized container and when I need to parse it, call make_heap on it just before so that it makes the event prioritized. 

Since I'll be parsing the event list only once per frame, I don't need to have it prioritized at all time.
My question is: in this situation, is make_heap more efficient than to keep the container up to date at all time? Or does it depend on the amount of data that I'm managing? Or am I over thinking it?

I am trying to do some homework and cannot wrap my head around a question. I have posted in the classes discussion board and emailed the professor but am not getting any help.
The question is:
Design a class abstractSort that can be used to analyze the number of comparisons performed by a sorting algorithm. The class should have a member function compare that is capable of comparing two array elements, and a means of keeping track of the number of comparisons performed. The class should be an abstract class with a pure virtual member function
which, when overridden, will sort the array by calling the compare function to determine with the relative order of pairs of numbers (that is the phrase I don't get). Create a subclass of AbstractSort that uses a simple sorting algorithm to implement the sort function. The class should have a member function that can be called after the sorting is done to determine the number of comparisons performed.
I have an idea of how to code this but I just don't think that I am going about it the way the question is worded. I have written code to keep track of comparisons by incrementing a counter and outputting that number. The question is bugging me however. What does the author mean by saying ""by calling the compare function to determine with the relative order of pairs of numbers ""

I have a a vector of pair with the following typdef

The vector then looks like this
My program has a number of time steps with slight variations in the double values and every time step I sort this vector with std::sort to something like this.
The idea is now to somehow use the vector from the last time step (the ""old vector, already sorted) to presort the current vector (the new vector, not yet sorted). And use an insertions sort or tim sort to sort the ""rest"" of the then presorted vector.
Is this somehow possible? I couldn't find a function to order the ""new"" vector of pairs by one part (the int part). 
And if it is possible could this be faster then sorting the whole unsorted ""new"" vector?
Thanks for any pointers into the right direction.
tiom
UPDATE
First of all thanks for all the suggestions and code examples. I will have a look at each of them and do some benchmarking if they will speed up the process.
Since there where some questions regarding the vectors I will try to explain in more detail what I want to accomplish. 
As I said I have a number if time steps 1 to n. For every time step I have a vector of double data values with approximately 260000 elements. 
In every time step I add an index to this vector which will result in a vector of pairs <double, int>. See the following code snippet.
(The index is 0 based. Sorry for my initial mistake in the example above)
I do this for every time step and then sort this vector of pairs with std::sort.
The idea was now to use the sorted vector of pairs  of time step j-1 (lets call it vectorOld) in time step j as a ""presorter"" for the ""new"" myVector since I assume the ordering of the sorted ""new"" myVector of time step j will only differ in some cases from the already sorted vectorOld of time step j-1.
With ""presorter"" I mean to rearrange the pairs in the ""new"" myVector into a vector presortedVector of type myVectorType  by the same index order as the vectorOld and then let a tim sort or some similar sorting algorithm that is good in presorted date do the rest of the sorting.
Some data examples: 
This is what the beginning of myVector looks like in time step j-1 before the sorting.
And after the sorting
So I in the next time step j this is my vectorOld and I  like to take the element with index 23836 of the ""new"" myVector and put it in the first place of the presortedVector, element with index 256594 should be the second element in presortedVector and so on. But the elements have to keep their original index. So 256594 will not be index 0 but only element 0 in presortedVector still with index 256594
I hope this is a better explanation of my plan.

Although this algorithm does sort correctly (as in after sorting things are in correct order), I know there is something wrong with this implementation as I tried to sort larger collections with it and compare timings with slower sorts, and I end up getting slow times for this iterative implementation. For example, sorting 500 items gives a time of 31 milliseconds with this implementation just like bubble sort does.

28757286,Sorting and clustering together arrays or vectors,"
I have the following data structure:
containing the following data:
Now I want to arrange my data in the following manner:
The ordering is achieved by first sorting by size the first vector of the first pair<> in the pair<>. Then lexicographically sorting the vectors. The second vector of the second pair in the pair<> is also sorted first by size of size and then it is lexicographically sorted. The data as a whole is clustered according of the second vector of the first pair<> in the pair<> of vector A. i.e. the user specifies to cluster together all elements of A together according to: ((101,102),(108,109),(101,102,110),(108,109,110),(111,112,120)) and ((51),(51,54),(40,54,59)).
I know it is possible to sort by (i). first size and (ii). then lexicographically sorting the vectors. By using the following code:
But I am not getting that how can I also cluster together the second vector of the first pair of pair of vectors of A while sorting ((i). by size (ii). and then lexicographical ordering). Can someone please help me with it.
Additionally the size of vector A which I have is very large. So, any solutions which can also be efficient will be an icing on the cake.
The version of gcc which I am using is: gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5) 4.6.3
I am fine with if the same could be achieved in c or c++ using any data structure (as I am only interested in the specific ordering that I have specified).

28726933,Can't get the radix sort algorithm to work in C++,"
Given n 32 bit integers (assume that they are positive), you want to sort them by first looking at the most significant shift in total bits and recursively sorting each bucket that is created by the sorted integers on those bits.
So if shift is 2, then you will first look at the two most significant bits in each 32 bit integer and then apply counting sort. Finally, from the groups that you will get, you recurse on each group and start sorting the numbers of each group by looking at the third and the fourth most significant bit. You do this recursively.
My code is following:
I can imagine only two issues in this code.
First issue is whether or not I actually get the correct bits of the integers in every iteration. I made the assumption that if I am in position currentDigit where if currentDigit = 0 it means that I am in bit 32 of my integer, then to get the next shift bits, I do a right shift by 32 - currentDigit - shift places and then I apply the AND operation to get the shift least most significant bits, which are exactly the bits that I want.
Second issue is in recursion. I do not think that I recurse on the right groups, but due to the fact that I have no idea whether the first issue is actually resolved correctly, I can not say more things about this at the moment.
any feedback on this would be appreciated.
thank you in advance.

For this assignment, we have a few tests we have to pass. The first one is a simple merge between two arrays. The second is the teachers own merge_sort function that he calls on some randomly sorted arrays. Here is my implementation of merge():
When he calls the first test, where he just checks the merging of two arrays, my function works, and the single array is now sorted. However, when he calls his merge_sort function, I end up getting garbage values. Here are his test functions:

One of the brute force solution is to exploit recursion. When we are at a certain character index of the string, we could either not change it or change it to some other character and recursively call the function with index incremented by one. If we change the character, increment the no. of operations by 1 else just pass it as is. At each step of the recursion, we can check whether the string sorted - if yes, then update the overall minimum with current count, if it's lesser than the current count.

Disclaimer: I know that parallel arrays are awful and should be avoided and that selection sort is not the most efficient sort, but in this case that's the way the boss man wants it done. I have looked at a lot of different websites and none that really seem to nail down an answer. Also, it is probably good to point out that I am new to C++ and only know fairly basic coding and debugging.
I have two simple parallel arrays and am trying to design a simple selection sort that sorts one of the arrays, and then swaps the elements in the second array accordingly. I have the selection sort part working, but it does not seem to swap the elements in my second array correctly.
Here is what my output looks like:

1        (jibberish)
  2        (jibberish)
  3        (jibberish) 
  4        (jibberish)
  5        (jibberish) 

Where I have (jibberish) the console does not form any identifiable letter, just odd shapes (if it's helpful, the last element that is output is a heart).
Here's what it is supposed to look like:

1        a
  2        b
  3        c
  4        d
  5        e

Now I realize that I could easily run a selection sort on the second array in this scenario, but my point is to get the second array to swap elements respective to what the selection sort does to the first array. 
Is there any way to keep these arrays lined up correctly? I've been trying to solve this issue for most of the day and I'm sure it's a fairly simple thing to figure out, but my brain is shot.
Below is my code, thanks in advance for looking at it.

29322524,Instant sort when put new value in array C++,"
I have a dynamically allocated array containing structs with a key pair value. I need to write an update(key,value) function that puts new struct into array or if struct with same key is already in the array it needs to update its value. Insert and Update is combined in one function.
The problem is:

Before adding a struct I need to check if struct with this key already existing.
I can go through all elements of array and compare key (very slow)
Or I can use binary search, but (!) array must be sorted. 
So I tried to sort array with each update (sloooow) or to sort it when calling binary search funtion.....which is each time updating

Finally, I thought that there must be a way of inserting a struct into array so it would be placed in a right place and be always sorted.
However, I couldn't think of an algorithm like that so I came here to ask for some help because google refuses to read my mind.
I need to make my code faster because my array accepts more that 50 000 structs and I'm using bubble sort (because I'm dumb).

I have a class with a structure of persons. Each person has its own name, primary ID and secondary ID. For effective searching I have implemented binary search. The problem is that I would like to effectively (better than O(n)) search persons not only by their primary ID, but also by their secondary ID. But the persons can be sorted only by one parameter. So I have thought if its possible to make two vectors of pointers to the persons structure, one sorted by their primary ID and the other one by their secondary ID.
For example, two persons: Mark Smith with primary ID 9845613 and secondary ID 1312469 and John Doyle, primary 3213444, secondary 2654722. So the first element of m_byPrim vector and second element of m_bySec vector should be pointing to John Doyle.
Is that even possible? Here is a part of the relevant code I have managed to write so far:
The position integer is the result of my binary search function (position to which insert persons), I have managed to implement that successfully, so just assume that this position will be already initialized. 
But my problem is how to implement the adding to the vector of pointers? I am still pretty new to the pointers (and C++ in general), so I don't know if my thought is valid and possible. Thank you for any tips & help.

29288110,sorting huge file that is almost sorted,"
I'm facing with the following problem:

I have a huge file (let's say 30 GB), that is streamed in memory with a specific API.

This API only allows me to read going forward (not backward). But the files can be read as many times as I want.
The file contains data that is almost all sorted, as in, 99% of the data is sorted but it can happen that a record is not in its correct position and should have been inserted much before if everything was sorted.


I'm trying to create a duplicate of this file, except it would need to be sorted.
Is there a graceful way to do this ?
The only way I can think of is the most generic way:

read the file
create batch of a few GB of memory, sort them, write them to a file on the HDD
use external merge to merge all these temporary files into the final output

However this is not using the specificities that the data is ""almost"" sorted. Would there be a better way to do this ? For instance without using external files on the HDD?

What I want:

For example:
(x0 y0), (x1,y1),(x2,y2)..., (xN,yN): acceptable 
(xN yN), (xN-1,yN-1),(xN-2,yN-2)..., (x0,y0): acceptable. 
(x0 y0), (x3,y3),(x1,y1)..., (xN,yN): not acceptable.
What I am stuck at:
I understand I can at least calculate each intersection with a for loop, but I don't know how to save the intersections with the order motioned above without sorting (bubble ex.). Say, I start from (x0,y0), then which way to go to find my first intersection? Particularly, should I go along x direction, or should I go along y direction, so that I can hit my first intersection? And how about the next move to my second one?
I figure is there anyway to do it in a ""natural"" geometry way? The slope (assuming the line is not vertical) of the line is known, and the meshgrid is known, so is there any trick we can play here? Thanks a lot

29829963,Counting the Number of Element Comparisons in Quick Sort,"
I have been provided this predefined code for Quick Sort which isn't to be altered much:
I know we already have questions on this but this is different as the logic is predefined here.
We are just required to make slight modification so that the quicksort returns the number of comparisons that it, and partition function together (in total) have performed in sorting the given array a. **In these comparisons, only the comparisons that involve array elements are counted. You are not allowed to use any global variable in counting these comparisons. **

This code is written in C++. I've the following structure:
The operator< will be used for sorting. The idea is to sort from highest-h to lowest-h, unless there is any overlapping between either b or w in comparing variables. Remaining code:
The way the I've written the operator< function, the code should output 2 4 6 1 3 5. But the output is 6 5 4 3 2 1. I'm using Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate.
After debugging the operator< function, I found out that it is being called for Data object as follows:
Note that when Data objects' h values are 1, 3 or 5, their b and w values are same. They will be sorted by ascending order of h. Same goes true for Data objects whose h values are 2, 4 and 6. But in the operator<() no two Data objects are ever compared whose h values are same! 1 compared to 2, 2 compared to 3, 3 compared to 4 and so on. So the overlap variable is always false. The outcome of sort() would be different if Data objects whose h values are same got compared - but that never happened!

I need to be able to quickly pick a victim for cache eviction from the bottom of such LRU, and be able to quickly iterate over some number of the best-performing entries from the top, so such container needs to be sorted.
So far, I was only be able to come up with a vector of structures that hold values for score calculation that are updated, and bi-directional links, which I use to put the updated element in place after score recalculation by linear search from its current position and score comparison. This search may obviously happen upwards (when the score is updated, always getting bigger) and downwards (when an element is evicted, and its score resets to 0). Linear search may not be so bad, because this is running for a long time, and scores of elements that survive grow large, and each increment is small, so the element does not have to move very far to get to its place, and in case of reset I can start search from bottom.
I am aware of STL sorted containers, folly's cache LRU implementation, and Boost.Bimap (this last one seems to be an overkill for what I need).

30067359,Came up with an algorithm for sorting an array of large sized objects; can anyone tell me what this algorithm is called? (couldn't find it on Google),"
I needed to sort an array of large sized objects and it got me thinking: could there be a way to minimize the number of swaps?
So I used quicksort (but any other fast sort should work here too) to sort indices to the elements in the array; indices are cheap to swap. Then I used those indices to swap the actual objects into their places. Unfortunately this uses O(n) additional space to store the indices. The code below illustrates the algorithm (which I'm calling IndexSort), and in my tests, appears to be faster than plain quicksort for arrays of large sized objects.
Now I have measured the swaps (of the large sized objects) done by both, quicksort, and IndexSort, and found that quicksort does a far greater number of swaps. So I know why IndexSort could be faster.
But can anyone with a more academic background explain why/how does this algorithm actually work? (it's not intuitive to me, although I somehow came up with it).
Thanks!
Edit: The following code was used to verify the results of IndexSort
Edit: Made the test less pathological; reduced the size of the large object class to just 1024 bytes (plus one int), and increased the number of objects to be sorted to one million. This still results in IndexSort being significantly faster than quicksort.
Edit: This requires more testing for sure. But it makes me think, what if std::sort could, at compile time, check the object size, and (depending on some size threshold) choose either the existing quicksort implemenation or this IndexSort implementation.
Also, IndexSort could be described as an ""in-place tag sort"" (see samgak's answer and my comments below).

30021646,C++ how to sort using non comparison based method,"
-You do a pass through the student array to count how many students there are in each school. You store the counts in a counts array.
-You allocate another array of Students with size equal to the input array. You will use this temp array to hold the sorted elements.
-Using the counts array you calculate the beginning index for each school in the sorted array by noticing that the starting index for a school is the cumulative number of students for all
the schools before it in the array. E.g.: if the counts are 5, 10, 12 for schools a, b, c then the
starting indexes for each school's students in the sorted array are 0, 5, 15
– You do another pass through the student array and whenever you encounter a student from a
school you add that student to the right portion of the helper array and increment that
portion's index.
-The helper array is now sorted by school and by ID within each school. Copy the helper
array's elements to the input array.
I'm having trouble with the last two bullet points. On paper i understand what the algorithm is doing but implementing the code is difficult for me.
The code I have below uses a counter to keep track of how many students go into 7 different school represented by the index of the counter array. It then does a cumulative count. What i need to code now starts from the right of my temp array and uses the cumulative to sort the array.

Need to show that a quicksort with a special partitioning, where an array gets partitioned into 3 parts (< than 3 pivot, = to pivot, > than pivot) and a special array of size N where only 7 distinct keys are possible can be sorted in O(N). 
So, I suppose we can assume the pivot is being chosen somewhere in the middle (otherwise we could have something like [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, .....] and that should take O(N^2)). 
Here is what I am thinking:
Suppose we did the first partitioning.  Now we move to the recursive step 2. Suppose we only focus on the right partition. Since every element here is greater than the pivot, and there were only 7 distinct keys, the number of distinct keys in this partition is strictly less than 7. This implies that after 7 iterations of the algorithm, all elements in the left and right sub-sub-...-partitions should be the same. 
Now, I can see how this would be O(N) if the algorithms stopped recurring on a constant array, but my understanding is that it doesn't.  Please clarify this if its not the case.

NOW HERE IS THE PROBLEM - I need to find how many DIFFERENT states there are in the given cities and construct an array of structures for them (structures like:
)
I dont know how I can find how many different states are in the array of structures, i tried sort to sort them out and then maybe remove duplicates, but it just sounds like such a hassle and I also failed to use sort, because we havent learned how to use it yet, and I dont think that is how we are supposed to do this task.
Please just tell me how I can find how many and what different states there are, I think i could do it from there.

30868414,sorting vector of pointers by two parameters,"
I am trying to sort a vector of pointers to a class A using std::sort, but am having some difficulties.
Imagine class A beings just a point, containing x and y coordinates. I want to sort the vector by y coordinates from biggest to lowest using some fixed offset value. And on top of this I want to sort it by x coordinatex, from lowest to biggest. I've had something like following in mind but as you can imagine its not working as wanted:
In short, if b->y < a->y - offset or b->y > a->y + offset treat it as b->y == a->y and then sort by their x coordinates from lowest to biggest. If the above is not true sort it as b->y < a->y.
How can I achieve this?
EDIT:
Imagine a xy plane such as this:  
where black dots represent class A with x and y coordinates. I want to split this plane into finitely many sections which are represented by the red lines and are wide as offset. Now I want to treat points in these sections as tho they had the same y coordinate and sort them only by their x coordinate.

30840491,Sort function giving floating point exception for a large input of 0's,"
I have written a code for this problem: 

Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.
For example, given [3, 30, 34, 5, 9], the largest formed number is 9534330.
Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

What basically I am trying to achieve in this code is to use radix sort logic on most significant digit first and arranging it as per decreasing order. Later I am doing for second most significant digit and so on. I have used std::sort() function by passing a vector of pairs, where first of the pair is the value and second of the pair is the index. The following is my code:
largestNumber(..) is my function which is returning the desired string. Now This code works fine for most non zero inputs that I could try. But when input is a long vector of 0's, something like:

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

30773596,Which STL container(s)/algorithm(s) could I use to solve this?,"
I have an MFC project which, given an initial root path, iterates through every file, folder and subfolder, and subsequently displays each file to the user in a List Control. Since this can easily become a rather lengthy operation, I occasionally yield control to the operating system (via processing a single message pump queue), allowing each of the elements discovered thus far to be displayed. Now here comes the tricky part...
I would like to keep the elements sorted by their last known modification timestamps, which (I believe) would require some kind of insertion sorting technique. Since some elements may contain duplicate timestamps, but different file paths, and we would be sorting by timestamp (stored as an std::string in the format of MM:DD:YY hh:mm), a simple std::vector doesn't appear to do the job. Also, I would prefer to not keep the user waiting for the entire operation to complete before starting to sort the elements, since the amount of time to wait is unknown and like I stated above, could easily become lengthy enough to make any person impatient.
Lastly, I would need some way to keep the elements inserted into the List Control equally mapped to the sorting operations on the container, so the user can see the most recently modified contents (and subcontents) of the root path in real-time.
What would be the proper container(s) and algorithm(s) to use in order to achieve this?
Here's basically what I'm doing now:

  The full answer appears to be a combination of galinette's (about the proper STL container), and foraidt's (about synchronizing the view with the data).

I'm creating a linked list that is sorting on insertion.  It's a template class, so type is defined at run-time.
The problem is, I am comparing two values to see which one is greatest, then I put that value in the spot within the linked list it is supposed to be.  This works all fine and dandy for any math based type, but it doesn't work well for strings.  It doesn't sort alphabetically.
Here's the code I'm trying to get working properly, so I can compare two strings and find out which one comes first alphabetically (but it's a template, so it has to work for other types as well)
The comparison code is here
Here's the full code, and I've included some code from main() below as well
With the below code, the end sorting result does not equal for the test.  It works fine for the integer test (also included), but not the string tests.  I end up with all upper case characters for at the beginning for the first A...Z string test, and some of the words for the full word test aren't in the correct places for the second string test.  In general, it's fairly accurate, but not fully alphabetical.
How can I make this alphabetically sorted?
EDIT:  My Unique Solution
I ended up finding out that my issue was not a pure alphabetic sorting issue.  It was actually in my code.  I was missing a situation where I would place the object I was trying to put in order inbetween the last object, and the second to last object.  It should have gone one past the last object.  This code will be cleaned up, as there are a bunch of areas that need to be cleaned up, but this should sort properly.  I was wrong about needing alphabetical sorting.
I marked the answer below, as I used this to resolve my issues, and it is also the answer to alphabetical order, which was my original question.  So, the original question is answered, but I found another issue that yields this question useless to me for my case, but others may need an answer to this question.

Then I compare it to all the elements and get the total number of comparisons. Elements that are smaller than the array should be behind the pivot followed by those that are bigger. So it should be pivot|elements smaller than pivot|elements greater than pivot. After comparing all the pivots, you should take the last element of the side that is smaller than the pivot and swap it with the pivot at the front. Currently I am lost on the how to make it recursive as I do believe I have successfully written code for the first pass. I am stuck trying to make it recursive so that it will call multiple passes of itself and that they are split. It would be stupid for it to sort all of it again. Instead, it should split the array into two parts, and recurse through the side smaller than the original pivot and the side bigger than the original pivot. This is a test case, as I later have to use this algorithm on a data file of 10,000 numbers (which is why I used long long although now that I think about it, it probably is overkill).
Below is my code in C++:
If I deleted the comments and ran the code with the commented part, it gives me error at long long temp = 0;, it will say exec bad access, even though it is able to run successfully. I use a mac and Xcode if it matters.

31666913,C/C++ - Efficient way to compare two lists and find missing elements,"
I have two lists, L1 and L2, of data containing multiple elements, each unique, of an abstract data type (ie: structs). Each of the two lists:

May contain between zero and one-hundred (inclusive) elements.
Contains no duplicate elements (each element is unique).
May or may not contain elements in the other list (ie: L1 and L2 might be identical, or contain completely different elements).
Is not sorted.
At the lowest level, is stored withing a std::vector<myStruct> container.

What I am typically expecting is that periodically, a new element is added to L2, or an element is subtracted/removed from it. I am trying to detect the differences in the two lists as efficiently (ie: with minimal comparisons) as possible:

If an entry is not present in L2 and is present in L1, carry out one operation: Handle_Missing_Element().
If an entry is present in L2 and not present in L1, carry out another operation: Handle_New_Element().

Once the above checks are carried out, L1 is set to be equal to L2, and at some time in the future, L2 is checked again.
How could I go about finding out the differences between the two lists? There are two approaches I can think of:

Compare both lists via every possible combination of elements. Possibly O(n2) execution complexity (horrible).



Sort the lists, and compare the two lists element-wise until I find a difference. This seems like it would be in near-linear time. The problem is that I would need the lists to be sorted. It would be impractical to manually sort the underlying vector after each addition/removal for the list. It would only be reasonable to do this if it were somehow possible to force vector::push_back() to automatically insert elements such that insertions preseve the sorting of the list.

Is there a straightforward way to accomplish this efficiently in C++? I've found similar such problems, but I need to do more than just find the intersection of two sets, or do such a test with just a set of integers, where sum-related tricks can be used, as I need to carry out different operations for ""new"" vs ""missing"" elements.
Thank you.

This question is about sorting with the array container in c++.  I am doing some comparisons of sort code.  I have a bubble sort and an array container in c++ in Mac Xcode.  The task is to build an array of random numbers and then sort those numbers and see how long it takes for the sort to be completed.  The bubble sort requires 59 seconds for 100,000 random numbers and 6,086 seconds for 1,000,000 random numbers.  I have not asked the bubble sort to try more than a million numbers.  The array container requires one second for 100,000 random numbers and fails at run time when presented with an array size of a million random numbers.  The failure occurs just inside main{...}, before any other statements are processed.  The first statement inside main, is a simple cout << ""this is a test of sorts \n"";
In Xcode, the error message is:  Thread1: EXC_BAD_ACCESS(code=2, address=0xfff5ecbd258)
The applicable code statements are shown below.
Note that I retyped the code here, so a typo is possible.  I hope the basic idea is complete enough for you to see what is going on. 
The following code is inside main
My question is... is there an upper limit for the array container?  if there is, how can I know what it is, and is there a work_around?  The max_size statement simply returns the size handed to the array by the #define statement. 
Is there a better, faster, way to sort a million items?

I have the following problem and would like to see if somebody could tell me if I'm on the right track with my approach:
I want to do a ""rolling window"" kind of computation on two linked lists and for that I need them to be sorted by magnitude. If I just have one linked list, writing the corresponding mergesort is not the problem. However, now I'm wondering how I should go about the fact that I have two linked lists where I want to have the corresponding elements from list 1 and list 2 move together as I sort by the magnitude of list 1. If this is not entirely clear, this is what I mean:
In list 1, I want to do a sort by magnitude, so basically just rearrange the pointers. Whenever I move element ""n"" in one list, however, I also need to move the corresponding element ""n"" in the other list to the same position as the element from the other one. 
Would my approach of using mergesort for this be the right way to go or does anyone know a better approach? I am having a hard time imagining how I would go about reordering the second list while mergesorting the first one since the second list is not necessarily going to be sorted by magnitude anymore and I need the individual elements to correspond to each other. 
Thanks!

I would want the result after using this comparator to look like this:
I had asked a similar question but not directed at using a comparator function when defining the map. The solution to my other question involved using the Boost library and tables. I'd like to keep this fairly simple and use my definition above.
Different options would be to use the sequence value as the key for the parent map, which can be done but I'd like to use that as the last option. Is the order of a map not changeable? I'm new to this type of thinking for C++ as I'm quite new, and it's hard coming from newer languages where something like this is a bit easier.

31122812,Sort multidimensional map based on pair value,"
I have a map defined as follows:  
GOAL:
I have a list of groups of commands. I want to sequence through each group in order. In order to do this, each group has a ""sequence"" value. I want to sort the overall list based on this value from smallest to largest. Essentially, I have a list of elements, which each have an accompanying list of other values within them specific to each parent. I want to sort the list of parents by a specific pair or value within the child lists.
For me to visualize this, I created an array in PHP with a similar structure. I'm not sure exactly how to visualize a C++ map so this is just me making assumptions. 1, 2, 3 are the keys of the map.
I'd like to sort this map based on the value of a particular pair inside, in this case ""sequence"". Element ""2"" should be below element ""3"" when sorting using the ""sequence"" value. The end result would look like this:
I'm sorry to mix languages here but there's no simple way for me to dump a map that depicts its structure (that I know of).
At first, my map was set up like so:  
This was easier for me to add elements and then access them later, but I figured a vector pair would be easier to use for sorting. I would prefer to use the latter definition for ease. I was looking at using std::sort and boost but I've had no luck implementing for this specific case.
Any comments/help is welcome. Thanks!

I want to sort this vector based on their distance to the query point.  The query point is not included in the results, and std::sort allows you to define a comparison function for two elements in the vector (rather than each element vs a fixed point).

32603876,overloaded operator< on pair not being used in sort,"
I have overloaded the less than operation for pair<int,int>, so that I can sort a vector in a particular manner. I want it to be in ascending order according to the first key of a pair, and if the first keys are equal, then I'd want it in descending order according to the second key.
The issue is that the sort function doesn't seem to be using the overloaded < operator, but if < is called on 2 pairs, the output returned is what I expect. I have attached a snippet of code below which I'm using for testing:
The input vector is {(1,10), (3,4), (3,8), (6,23), (1,6)}.
I expect the output to be {(1,10), (1,6), (3,8), (3,4), (6,23)}.
Obtained output is {(1,6), (1,10), (3,4), (3,8), (6, 23)}.
As you can see, the obtained output is the one you'd get by using the standard < operator without overloading. So I thought that this might be an issue, and checked (3,4) < (3,8). In this case, the answer was returned as false, in accordance to my overloaded operator. So where am I going wrong? Why isn't sort being affected by the overloaded operator? There are various questions on SO about similar issues, but couldn't find any that helped.

Tail in the main function because I cannot set tail parameter's type since 2 arguments use the same type and then go on to the next time in the parameter pack. Although it works, I'm not fully content with it as it breaks IDE error detection(at least in VS).

32586825,Why is std::shuffle as slow (or even slower than) std::sort?,"
Consider the simple code that measures execution time and the number of swaps performed:
The output of the program depends on the compiler and the machine, but they are quite similar in their nature. On my laptop with VS2015, I get 1044ms with ~100 million swaps for sort and 824ms with 10 million swaps for shuffle. 
libstdc++ and libc++ do twice as few swaps for sort (~50M) and the results are as follows. Rextester gives me similar results: gcc sort 854ms, shuffle 565ms, clang sort 874ms, shuffle 648ms. The results shown by ideone and coliru are even more drastic: ideone sort 1181ms, shuffle 1292ms and coliru sort 1157ms, shuffle 1461ms. 
So what's the culprit here? Why with 5 to 10 times more swaps sort is almost as fast or even faster than a simple shuffle? I'm not even taking into account comparisons and more complex logic in std::sort including choosing insertion, heap or quick sort algorithms, etc. I doubt it's the random engine - I've even chosen the simplest one std::minstd_rand which basically does an integer multiplication and a modulo. Is it the cache misses that make shuffle relatively slow?
PS: the behaviour is the same for simple std::vector<int>

For my code, you can assume binary search and quick sort are properly implemented. Quick sort was supposed to give you how many times it compared things, however i never figured out how to return two things (the comparisons and the index).

I'm playing around with figuring out some dependency stuff, and I got far, but now I'm stuck.
Let's say I have a data struct like this:

Further, lets say the map has 4 keys (A, B, C, and D) with the following dependency entries:

32058631,C++ sorting container of base class pointers to derived objects,"
I have an std::list of base class pointers, all of which point to one of the two derived object classes. An instance of the base class is never declared, and, although the base class is not abstract, every member function is declared as virtual. Consider the code below:
These classes are instantiated as the appropriate base class via conditional statements and stored in an std::list by the base class pointer simultaneously in the same block of code like so:
I need to perform an insertion sort on this container of base class pointers based on an integer value that both derived classes inherit; however, in my previous attempts and upon inspection with a debugger tool, I find that my insertion sort algorithm properly makes the correct comparisons when accessing the integer that the comparison is based on, but I am unable to swap the position of the base class pointers in the std::list. I want to sort this container of pointers so that I can easily print the data in the proper order with a simple for loop.
This is clearly the result of a misunderstanding of pointer semantics, but to much avail I have been unable to find any reference or example that elucidates or solves the issue I am experiencing. 
Any result that I have found either on this site or elsewhere solves this problem by using a container of the actual objects instead of a container of pointers to the objects. But, in my case, I can't do this because my code relies on the polymorphic behavior of the base class in order to have one big list of derived objects, instead of multiple lists for each derived object. Obviously, this makes calling member functions of the correct derived class extremely easy, and I would rather not redesign the entire structure of my data if I can avoid it.
If requested, I can post snippets of my code and/or the attempts that I have made to properly swap these pointer positions inside the container; however, I am unsure if this would even be helpful, since I am clearly using the wrong syntax to handle the pointers.
I appreciate any feedback; this problem has been plaguing me for the past few weeks and it is definitely time for me to step back and ask for assistance. I have a feeling that I am over-analyzing this issue, and that is most likely what is preventing me from solving the problem.

The function
is to sort the container c according to the ordering criterion comp, but those elements that satisfy pred shall remain fixed in their original positions after the sort (i.e. unaffected by the sort).
I tried to adapt quick sort to fit this, but could not think of it.  In the end, I decided to adapt the crude selection sort to get the job done:
But the time complexity is O(N^2) (I think).  Can someone improve on the time complexity here, to perhaps O(NlogN) on average?  In other words, find an overall better algorithm, using recursion or something like that?
Or perhaps a better idea is to take out the elements that satisfy pred, sort what left with std::sort and then put the extracted elements back in their original positions?  Would that be any more efficient, or would that just make it worse?
Update:
This is based on Beta's suggestion (sorting the iterators that don't pass pred).  But though the elements that pass pred do indeed remain fixed, the sorting at the end is not correct.
The incorrect output is 11 9 9 8 11 3 20 2 9 when it should be 11 9 7 8 5 3 20 2 1.

According to the Qt docs for QSortFilterProxyModel::lessThan():

bool QSortFilterProxyModel::lessThan(const QModelIndex & left, const QModelIndex & right) const [virtual protected]
Returns true if the value of the item referred to by the given index left is less than the value of the item referred to by the given index right, otherwise returns false.
This function is used as the < operator when sorting, and handles the following QVariant types: 
[... snip built-in types ...]
Any other type will be converted to a QString using QVariant::toString().

And the docs for QVariant::toString() say:

QString QVariant::toString() const
Returns the variant as a QString if the variant has type() String, Bool, ByteArray, Char, Date, DateTime, Double, Int, LongLong, StringList, Time, UInt, or ULongLong; otherwise returns an empty string.

Assume, that elements in a and b are very heavyweight. I.e. you can't make its copies.
What is the perfect STL-way to do it? How to use std::sort to perform the operation? What to do if a is const?
What I do currently:
But I can't provide free swap (based on P::swap) function for struct P. Is it unavoidable limitation of the language (I can't define non-lambda function inside function scope, but can define non-template class)?
ADDITIONAL:
I found that presence the swap free function overloading is not the type requirement for std::sort function. Just MoveConstructible and MoveAssignable are. Therefore the code is more appropriate (but still incomplete). There is the really hard issue: swap of elements in range provided to std::sort is (evidently) splitted into series of consistuent operations: T tmp(std::move(lhs)); lhs = std::move(rhs); rhs = std::move(tmp);. Therefore I can't swap (during std::sort) referenced elements of containers itself but only the iterators to them.

31930044,std::stable_sort not stable at all?,"
I'm running into a bizarre bug when using std::stable_sort on a Point datatype. The default ordering of Point values is determined first by x-coordinate and then by y-coordinate to break ties. However, I'm using std::stable_sort to sort points based on their slopes relative to an external point. And I keep finding that std::stable_sort does not preserve the relative ordering of points with the same slope relative to the external point.
Here is code that executes correctly and yields the expected output.
But when I use std::stable_sort to sort the vector based on the slopes of all elements relative to the first one, the vector is no longer sorted in order of increasing x-coordinate even among points with the same slope.
In general, std::stable_sort seems to consistently, magically reverse the relative ordering of elements that compare to have the same slope. Other than that, the methods referenced above seem to work fine. I've posted the methods of the Point class below (other than operator<<), but I don't see how a bug in any of those should cause std::stable_sort to become unstable.

33081856,Randomly generated sorted arrays: search performances comparison,"
I'm making a program that tests and compares stats of Multi-Key Sequential search and Interpolation binary search. I'm asking for an advice: 
What is the best way to sort a random-generated array of integers, or even generate it like a sorted one (if that makes any sense) in given context?
I was looking into some sorting techniques, but, if you keep in mind that the accent is on searching (not sorting) performance, all of the advanced sorts seem rather complicated to be used in just one utility method. Considering that the array has to be larger than 106 (for testing purposes), Modified/Bubble, Selection or Insertion sorts are not an option. 
Additional constraint is that all of the array members must be unique.
Now, my initial idea was to split the interval [INT_MIN,INT_MAX] into n intervals (n being the array length) and then add a random integer from, 0 to 232/n (rounded down), to every interval beginning. 
The problem is this:
I presume that, as n rises closer to 232, like mine does, Interpolation search begins to give better and better results, as it's interpolation gets more accurate.
However:
If I rely solely on pseudo-random number generators (like rand();), their dispersion characteristics dictate the same tendency for a generated-then-sorted array, that is - Interpolation gets better at pinpointing the most likely location as the size gets closer to int limit. Uniformity/dispersion characteristics get lost as n rises to INT_MAX, so, due to stated limitations, Interpolation seems to always win.
Feel free do discuss, criticize and clarify this question as you see fit, but I'm rather desperate for an answer, because the test seems to be rigged in Interpolation's favor either way and I want to analyze them fairly. In short: I want to be convinced that my initial idea doesn't tilt the scales in Interpolation's favor even further, and I want to use it because it's O(n).

I have to sort a collection of vectors with OpenMP in C++. I really think this should be a common problem; however, I never found anything about it. 
Of course I could just use
and leave the scheduling to the runtime.
However, one array could take longer than all the others combined. Actually, I might well only have one array. 
Or I might, say, have twenty thousands with a hundred elements each, plus two with a million each. In that case, if I have 8 cores, I'd like to assign five thousands sections per thread for the first four threads, and then two threads per section with the last four. So that the total time is constant. 
I might then use nested parallelism. But if I do this
where sortParallel spawns the correct number of threads to balance the workload, OMP will still start processing as many threads as possible; and then the nested parallelism will most probably oversubscribe. This seems bad, especially since the sortParallel routine has a lot of barriers. 
The ideal solution would be to tell for how many threds every iteration will need, so that it might avoid starting new tasks if it would oversubscribe, but this doesn't seem possible. 
I might have to notice that it should compile under VisualStudio 2013, so, it seems OpenMP 2.0 -and in particular, no tasks. 
I am now exploring weird combinations of deep nestings of parallel region. But I'd really rather not do that. Is there some obvious solution I am missing? 
My last design starts from the fact that, if the thread division is done correctly, then the big sections never take (too much) longer than total/threads. And the same will do the small sections, if we properly divide them among the remaining threads. So we don't really need to scramble to reuse the threads we used to sort the bigger vectors; since they will finish (alas, roughly) all at the same time anyway. 
Therefore, I can just divide long intervals and small intervals in different vectors, put in threads[i] a partition of the number of threads which tries to create optimal balance, and do this
This avoids oversubscription, since the threads spawned by each iteration are designed to sum to the available total. Is there a simpler/cleaner/faster solution?

32655257,Is there a true quick sort algorithm for C++?,"
edit: The OP's confusion resulted from assuming the pivot had fixed position.  It actually moves depending on how many elements are <= to it.  It didn't help that one of the examples chooses 7 as a pivot element, ends up swapping it to a higher index, and finishing the first pass with a 7 from a different element in the position where the pivot started.
Ever since I learned about quick sort in CS and then started applying it with code, I have struggled with the concept that the code is executing a true quick sort algorithm.  The idea of quick sort is simple: a pivot from the original array is chosen, and all other numbers from the array are sorted to the left or right of that pivot.  Then each sub-array (items left of pivot and right of pivot) is sorted via the same method through a recursive call until the entire array is sorted.
In practice, every language I come across seems to have the same accepted general code to accomplish this.  It looks like this (from http://www.algolist.net/Algorithms/Sorting/Quicksort):
However, as you can see from the website's own visual, when the first partition is stopped, a '3' is still to the right of the chosen '7' pivot.  I have also observed this when testing other arrays.  For [6, 5, 1, 3, 8, 4, 7, 9, 2], the first pivot is 8.  After the first partition, 8 ends up to the right of the 9 all the way until the last recursive call.  Has anyone noticed this before?

33307957,Calling std::nth_element() function extremely frequently,"
I did not find this specific topic anywhere...
I am calling the nth_element() algorithm about 400,000 times per second on different data in a std::vector of 23 integers, more precise ""unsigned short"" values. 
I want to improve computation speed and this particular call needs a significant portion of CPU time.
Now I noted, as with std::sort(), that the nth_element function is visible in the profiler even with highest optimisation level and NDEBUG mode (Linux Clang compiler), so the comparison is inlined but not the function call itself. Well, more preise: not nth_element() but std::__introselect() is visible.
Since the size of the data is small, I experimented with using a quadratic sorting function PIKSORT, which is often quicker than calling std::sort when the size of data is less than 20 elements, probably because the function will be inline.
However this was slower than using nth_element in this case.
Also, using a statistical method is not appropriate, Something faster than std::nth_element
Finally, since the values are in the range from 0 to about 20000, a histogram method does not look appropriate. 
My question: does anyone know a simple solution to this? I think I am probably not the only one to have to call std::sort or nth_element very frequently.

However, when I changed the functor to return true each time, all the values get added to the set in the order they were inserted [1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 1]. I thought that when the functor comparator returns true, it is treated as if the first element is smaller than the second element, and false means that the first element is treated as grater than the second element? It seems to be the case when I did return (a < b); and  return (a > b); in the operator function.

The array is already sorted by b. I need to check a condition on ai and find first ai which satisfies a condition.
A simple method would be to start checking from i=0 to i=N linearly. But this doesn't take advantage of the fact that if the condition fails for a specific value of a say 10, then only values that may pass the test are those greater than a, that is greater than 10.
Maybe I should have a copy of array sorted by a, so that when a condn fails for some value of a, I can check for value of a greater than failed value.

34348611,Time complexity difference between two containsDuplicates algorithms,"
I completed two version of a leetcode algorithm and am wondering if my complexity analysis is correct, even though the online submission time in ms does not show it accurately. The goal is to take a vector of numbers as a reference and return true if it contains duplicate values and false if it does not.
The two most intuitive approaches are:
1.) Sort the vector and do one sweep to the second to last, and see if any neighboring elements are identical and return true if so.
2.) Use a hashtable and insert the values and if a key already exists in the table, return true.
I completed the first version first, and it was quick, but seeing as how the sort routine would take O(nlog(n)) and the hash table inserts & map.count()s would make the second version O(log(n) + N) = O(N) I would think the hashing version would be faster with very large data sets.
In the online judging I was proven wrong, however I assumed they weren't using large enough data sets to offset the std::map overhead. So I ran a lot of tests repeatedly filling vectors up to a size between 0 and 10000 incrementing by 2, adding random values in between 0 and 20000. I piped the output to a csv file and plotted it on linux and here's the image I got.

Is the provided image truly showing me the difference here, between an O(N) and an O(nlog(n)) algorithm? I just want to make sure my complexity analysis is correct on these?

I tried printing their ids inside the operator() (so you guys can actually kind of debug it) , where comparisons actually happens, and it gave me the output:

If I use the en_EN.UTF-8 locale, the words with accent in my language (portuguese-Brazil) will be in different order that I want. So I use pt_BR.UTF-8. But, the string ""as"" is before ""a"", and I want ""a"" and then ""as"".

34053986,Sort Array of Indexes Into Primary Array,"
I'm coding a C++ dll to sort a SAFEARRAY passed from VBA.
I'm not using any OLE libraries, but rather accessing the array descriptor and data directly.
I have no problem sorting an array of any native VBA types. For example, the following fragment sorts an array of BSTRs:
...which uses this comparison function:
I realize I'm cheating here since wchar_t is very different from BSTR, but it's not common to have a zero char within the payload of an Excel string and so I'm OK with that. The above works well.
THE PROBLEM
I want the dll to optionally be able to sort a companion array of indexes into the primary data array. In this mode only the index array would be sorted, leaving the source data untouched.
My research suggests that a lamda functor may be the most promising path as I'd prefer not to allocate memory for additional arrays or vectors of data or pairs.
In particular, this answer seems very promising.
However, I cannot work out how to adapt it to my situation where I'm processing the raw pointers to the BSTRs that begin at pData.

I am required to create global semaphore variables, I've done something like this before, example: 
sim_semaphore empty[i] ;
sim_semaphore full[i] ;
Could I use the same logic again? Meaning while a cell has a value (aka is full) and is being swapped, I would just use the signal/wait commands accordingly? Could I solve this using only two different semaphores?
Next I would have to initialize them inside of init(), the last time I did this I used a for-loop, example:
for (index=0; index<numTrivets; index++) full[index] = create_sim_sem(0) ;
Is this the most efficient way to do this again?
Lastly, where it says I need entry and exit code, I thought about using Peterson's solution by initializing boolean flag and setting flag = 1 for the first pass and back to flag = 0 when it finishes. However, I have come to believe it is not the ""most correct"" method of trying to solve this program. What should I do in its stead?

34756562,Sort an array of strings,"
I need a quick hint on this function.
So basically I have this struct, used by a class.
That is, an array of which each element is a string and a bool, but the the last one is not important now.
The ! operator has to sort the array in alphabetical order.
Here's how I tried to do it.
First 7 lines check if each bool of each element of the array is true, otherwise it won't execute. Then it starts to sort.
That's how I tried to do it but it doesn't work.
P.S. The solution has to use an auxilary pointer, something like:
     aux=i;
     i=j;
     j=aux;

The assignment I have asks me to write a class that displays the time it takes (in milliseconds) to sort an array that holds 100,000 randomly generated items using a selection sort. 
My idea was to get the time before I sorted it, then after the for loop of the sort broke out, to take the time again, then subtract this new time by the old time. With my existing code, I get 0. One other question I had is my teacher instructed us to only use ctime and time(0) in the program, but looking into it, it seems that there are many other useful functions to write this program with. Can anyone give insight to the best way possible to do this, or as to why my teacher would have us only use this one function in ctime?

I have a class Data which is (as for now) non-copyable. std::sort on std::vector<Data> works because I have defined move-constructor and move-assignment for Data. I do it this way because the class has a lot of data inside and copying the contents would be too slow. However, I am considering now adding a copy constructor Data(const Data& other) and standard assignment operator (from const Data&) to the class, for unrelated reasons.

34657044,Sorting vector of instances,"
I am currently taking a coding class at university and they have VERY specific requirements for the homework assignments.
For this week we have a class called Npt that represents a Nobel Prize winner.  This class contains, amongst other things, the Name, the year of the prize and the field of the winner.
Now we should make another class, Nobelpreise, that contains a container for instances of said Nobel prize winner class.  We are supposed to sort the elements of that container by the year of the Nobel Prize.
I wasn't able to use the std::sort function with a custom comparator correctly.  This is what my code roughly looks like:
The method get_jverl() comes from the Npt class and just returns the year.
Now the sort function always gives back an error saying that:
requires two arguments.  Shouldn’t they be provided by the sort function?
I have also tried to overload the < operator which does not seem to work either.
edit1: added end() and removed the () from Npl.mycomp

34654693,how iterating on std::map returns sorted elements based on the key value,"
The container std::map is a data structure that STL provides. In almost all compilers it is implemented as a R&B tree with guaranteed log(n) insertion, find and removal time.
In a red and black tree the elements are sorted based on the ""less"" operator of the stored element. So basically if a root is N + 1 , N will be on the left sub-tree while N + 2 will be on the right sub-tree and this ordering will be decided by the less operator.
My question is when executing the below code:
This is the output of the code: 
a
b
c
d
e
f
g
h
The elements are returned in a sorted order based on the key value. How can this be possible considering the fact that the underlying data structure is a red and black tree? How c++ iterates from the leftmost sub-tree to rightmost sub-tree is it a doubly linked r&b tree?

Then lets say I insert a few pairs into the set then I want to find one of those pair by searching for the ""key"" being stored as the first item in the pair. I think it would involve calling the .first on the pair but im just having trouble with that. This is the basic function im trying to implement

35818747,Why does sorting call the comparison function less often than a linear minimum search algorithm?,"
I'll start by giving some context. I'm learning to write a raytracer, a very simple one. I don't have any acceleration structures yet, so the code in question is intended to find the closest object that the ray hits. Since I'm learning yet, I'd greatly appreciate if the answers concentrated on the seemingly strange problem that I'm observing - I know the RT logic is very wrong as it is right now. It produces correct results, anyway.
1. The first approach: for every hit, add a hit-result structure object to the list, then apply std::sort with a predicate that compares the distance form the hit point to the ray origin. Should be O(N log N) according to the textbook, and I think it is suboptimal, since I only need the first result, not the whole sorted list.
2. The second approach: whenever there is a hit, take the distance and compare it to the minimum, which is first initialized to std::numeric_limits<float>::max(). Well, your standard ""find min in the array"" algorithm. Should be O(N) and thus faster.
These pieces of code reside in a recursive function. Tested on the very same scene of 10 spheres, 1 is faster by an order of magnitude. The amount of calls to the distance function is a few times less than in 2. What am I missing?
I'm not sure if the context is required, in case there are ""branches to be cut"" off this question, tell me.

Code piece 1:

count == 180771


Code piece 2:

count == 349633

I want to (a) understand why there are less comparisons and (b) where the bottleneck is, since the run time is significantly higher, as I've noted above.

I feel very confused about why this C++ code snippet acts differently when I assign the array value with rand() or with any constant value.

After the assignment it sorts with quicksort algorithms of which I'm going to provide mine below and then deallocates this array when its done. This whole thing repeats up to MAX_SIZE(100,000).

In this case I'm facing with a strange problem: when I assign each value of the array to a random number using rand() function, everything works just fine, however, when I enter a constant value, the size of the array goes up to 4039(when you manipulate MAX_SIZE and MIN_SIZE) then gives a stack overflow error.

(b) Give an algorithm to sort in 2n/3 comparisons in the average case (assuming each of the n inputs is 0 or 1 with equal probability). Show that your algorithm is optimal.

35631554,MySQL and database queries: sorting,"
First of all, sorry for my english.
I have a C++ desktop application which gets rows from a database, and, for each row, the app creates an object which represent that row from that specific table. Each table has its corresponding class (I use ODB for that).
Once I've recovered the rows of a table, I show them in a table, which can be sorted by columns. Each column has a ""sort"" icon which allows to sort the table entries according to that column.
My question is, what is what quality apps usually do? Making other query each time the table must be sorted? or to sort the objects manually, using for example, a std::set? Which is faster?
I think sorting the entries using a std::set is faster because we avoid communication with the MySQL server, but at the same time perhaps the MySQL optimizer do some magic if we reorder multiple times the same database table, specially with index involved. I think that it could even depend on the frequency of these sort operations.
Anyway, I want to know pros and cons of both approaches.

I got quite decent speedup using __gnu_parallel::sort

im working on a console application in C++ (I'm a beginner)

Now, i want to group up data of binary file (class9.dat) such that all the students with common batch id ( char type batch[5] ) should stuck together , by saying ""stuck together"", i mean 
if initially, consider binary file consider data in this form 
then, after stucking data together (or grouping them up ) , data should be arranged in file as follow 
(note that the data is arranged in the order in which they are read/encountered first from top-to-bottom) 
ok, now i tried myself alot and even i think i found a solution to this problem, i used concept of dynamic linked list (stack) to keep check whether a particular batch ID is arranged properly or not 
below is a code snippet for the function void_update()
This is the function code snippet, for your reference im leaving code-snippets of 2 other functions which are belonging to stacks 
here they are
this is it, now let me tell you whats my approach to this problem 
what im trying to do is basically i pass student's batch id to another char variable temp_batch , then i check if temp_batch aldready exists in my stack (which contain list of all batch ids on which function is already performed) 
if temp_batch do not exists in my stack then, it means that the data having batch id as temp_batch is not grouped up , so run a while-loop which read whole file from beg to end and when it found the record having batch id same as temp_batch, it is appended to temp.dat in this manner for every record on file, it is expected to group up records together. but this is not working 
whats problem is , when i run this code 
instead of grouping all records , it only GROUPS UP records of that BATCH ID which it encounter first, rest it ignores all other and do not send them to temp.dat 
example, consider above example, then this is the record which will be sended to temp.dat after whole process 
please help me, i did alot of inspection of code , again and again but failed to get the problem... and yes, thanks for reading this whole question upto this point.

36117142,Sorting boost's multi_array using sort function and a recursive comparator,"
I work on big data and program in c++. For example, I need to create 4-dimensional arrays of size [7 x 128^3 x 5 x 5] etc. I will have to create many more arrays as intermediate data structures for different properties. After researching a lot, I finally chose boost's multi_array to implement my data structures. I chose multi_array for two reasons:
(1) It handles exceptions such as array index out of bound which is very important to me for debugging.
(2) It handles arrays of higher dimensions (other options such as stl's multi dimensional arrays have lots of problems with arrays of 3 and higher dimensions)

Problem example.
It becomes easy if I explain the problem using an example. Say, I have the following 3-D array.
I want to sort these rows in such a way that the sorting must happen based on column_1, then column_2, and then column_3. After sorting I will have
You see that column_1 is sorted. For every two rows that have same column_1, then column_2 is sorted, and so on.

What I have tried.
I was able to solve this problem with ordinary 3-D array and writing a recursive comparator and calling the library's sort function (that uses the comparator). But, after I changed to boost's multi_array I have not been able to solve the problem. I searched a lot for boost documentation I could not find any solution. I do not know how to write a recursive comparator for sorting the boost multi_array.

Question.
Can someone give me the exact working syntax of the recursive comparator for boost multi_array to sort the multi_array? The code must not use APIs that depend on the specific compiler / operating system. Assume the dimensions of multi_array A as n1 x n2 x ... x nd.
Thanks.

Reply to Yakk.
recursive comparator is like this:
sort function that uses the recursive comparator is like this:
the multi-dimensional array is like this:
I have not included many other details of what does each parameter represents because it gets messy (as it tries to do many other things) but the core idea is as explained in the example.
What I want to do is to write a recursive comparator for the multi_array as defined by the following.
I cannot simply write the comparator like the compareByID as I do not how to pass arguments to comparator function when the object is a multi_array.
Does this help?

Reply to sehe.
Excellent solution. Thanks a ton. It seems that you are a genius in using boost and c++. It totally worked. The idea you have used for swap and comparator function is amazing. I had no idea that these function calls (such as lexicographical_compare() etc) even existed. Thank you so much.
I have two related questions:
(1) Say, we sort a multi_array A for all dimensions. We want to apply the identical swaps / exchanges / transformations to multi_array B. Can we do this with the idea you have given? 
I understand that we can solve this problem by writing a separate custom sorter (when we swap, we can swap components both in A and B). But I am curious if this problem can be solved with the comparator concept because the comparator does not know anything about the multi_array B when we are using it to sort A. How to solve this problem?
(2) Is it really necessary that we have several overloaded functions in my_comp? Can't we have one totally generic function for that purpose? (Sorry, I am new to multi_array, sub_array concepts).

What I'm not sure about is a few things.

Is it valid to have these sort methods to be passed into std::sort within a class? - I do not see why this should be a problem.
Do I need to have the parameters for the sort function to be passed to std::sort as the objects themselves or the smart pointer of them? It would make sense to pass the smart pointer since this is what is stored in the vector since we are working with the iterators begin() and end().

this function checks if list is empty , if yes , it inserts node to head and tail ( e.g head = tail  = there is only one node in list );
What troubles me is function to insert a node
If list is empty , it invokes insertNode() , if value of the node is smaller than value of previous node , it crawls the list to find its spot.
This piece code works only if the first node inserted is also a smallest node there will be. e.g
works and if i print the list it is nice sorted. but
the first node isnt the smallest node , it crashes the program. I thought it was i was comparing a value to nullptr so i added the piece of code which you can see in insertIt() function and that is

36892117,How to go from sorting numbers to sorting alphabetically in C++,"
I revised this question after pondering what I would like some help with. They way I have currently only sorts text from a file based on their tax_rate a.k.a by numbers. I need to sort context inside a text file like this:  
Original context:

bLack car 200.00
  jumbo Car 82.00
  AlPha caR 2932.00  

Sorted context:

AlPha caR 2932.00
  bLack car 200.00
  jumbo Car 82.00

A code I used when I was using this code to sort by tax rate. 


How different would it be to sort from numbers to sorting by words via Alphabetical?
If you see anything unclear in the question, let me know so that I can clear it up. Thanks.

36830638,Knowing if middle vertex is left or right when sorting a triangle vertices by Y?,"
I'm reading Chris Hecker's Texture Mapping articles and for the life of me I can't understand how he's using the Y order of vertices to determine if the middle vertex was on the left or right.
Sorting code:
Then he writes:
My questions:

How are we relying on the Y order to tell if the middle vertex is left or right? It's really confusing cause the sorting is only done on Y, there was no mention of X.
Obviously, the BottomCompare and MiddleCompare variables exist to achieve the comparison. In the first half of the comparison (the 'if'), MiddleCompare equals Middle and BottomCompare equals Bottom. But in the second half (the 'else') BottomCompare equals 3 when Bottom equals 0, and MiddleCompare equals 3 when Middle equals 0. Why is that?

I'm trying to sort a vector of objects so that objects with the same properties are right next to each other. Task is a class that takes and holds 3 pointers to some data somewhere.
If I have a vector full of these, I want to sort them so that any Task that has equal propertyOne, propertyTwo, and propertyThree are put next to each other in the vector. If the two Task objects properties are not equal, it doesn't really matter where they go. Although it would be nice for them to go next to the Task objects that they have the most in common with.
How do I do this? I've tried the obvious (return a.propertyOne == b.propertyOne) but that didn't seem to work at all, and also it only compares the first property.

36777834,Sort std::vector<int> but ignore a certain number,"
I have an std::vector<int> of the size 10 and each entry is initially -1. This vector represents a leaderboard for my game (high scores), and -1 just means there is no score for that entry.
When the game is started, I want to load the high score from a file. I load each line (up to 10 lines), convert the value that is found to an int with std::stoi, and if the number is >0 I replace it with the -1 currently in the vector at the current position.
All this works. Now to the problem:
Since the values in the file aren't necessarily sorted, I want to sort myVector after I load all entries. I do this with
This sorts it in ascending order (lower score is better in my game).
The problem is that, since the vector is initially filled with -1 and there aren't necessarily 10 entries saved in the high scores file, the vector might contain a few -1 in addition to the player's scores. 
That means when sorting the vector with the above code, all the -1 will appear before the player's scores.
My question is: How do I sort the vector (in ascending order), but all entries with -1 will be put at the end (since they don't represent a real score)?

36726723,Is sort() automatically using move semantics?,"
isocpp.org states that:

move-based std::sort() and std::set::insert() have been measured to be
  15 times faster than copy based versions[...] if your type has a move
  operation, you gain the performance benefits automatically from the
  standard algorithms.

Does this mean that if you call sort() on a user-defined type that has no move constructor or move assignment operator, then there are no move semantics used? In other words, to get the many benefits of C++11 performance improvements, you should edit existing code to add move operations explicitly?
Further, if you are sorting, is it the container or the type inside the container, or both, that must have move operations defined?

What I'm stuck on is while sorting the strings I want to sort the array of doubles in ascending order and keep the scores with the name they are associated with. I'm trying to learn it without using vectors before I go on to learn how to manipulate them, that's the reason for not using vectors before anyone asks. 
Is it best to sort the columns of the 2d array and than sort them with the 1d array or just to have a statement that does it all? Also what would be the best sorting algorithm for this application? 
My attempts have all failed so far so I turn to the community here for help. The logic is most likely some simple concept that I have yet to grasp. We all have to start somewhere. Thank you in advance for your help.

The thing is that these tweets(I called them ""baa""s) must be in order according to an ID( the largest ID must be shown the first and the smallest the last one). So the problem is how to implement this in an efficient way.
I have all the messages stored in a map with Username as primary key. Each line of the map is a vector of messages, where messges is a Struct which has the Baa, Time(in which it was written) and the ID. The message struct is defined like this:
An the map for data and followers like this:
An additional difficulty is that I need to make this in the sever because the client just prints what he receives, so we have to send the ""Baa""s in order. I currently have this code for sending all the Baas of a single user to the client (which prints in descendent way using reverse iterator):
I can print all the followers timeline in this way, but the tweets are ordered in ascendent ID order(1,2,3...) instead of descendent(...3,2,1)
I dont know how is the most efficient way of printing all follower's tweets in descendent order. Maybe there is an eficcient way of accessing the struct of messages in order according to the ID, or maybe allocating memory and storing (with ID as Key parameter) just the structs of messages of the users you follow, etc.
Which is the best way to implement this function?

I have a set of objects(each object contains a rectangle and a value assigned to it) which is kept in a vector container.
See picture below:

I need to create a matrix by drawing horizontal and vertical lines at each y/x lower left (LL) / upper right(UR) coordinate like below:

And I need to assign value = 0 to each new empty rectangle, and to other rectangles which are inside of initial rectangles, I need to assign their old values.
I've implemented this with some naive algorithm but it works too slow when I have huge number of rectangles. My algorithm basically does the following: 
- Stores all rectangles in a map container. Each element of the map contains set of rectangles with the same LL Y coordinate and they are sorted by LL X coordinate, i.e. key is LL Y coordinate.
- Stores all X/Y coordinates in set containers.
- Iterates over Y/X coordinate containers, and for each new rectangle finds out if it exists in map or not, if exists-assigns existing value to it, otherwise-assigns 0 value. I.e, for each new rectangle it looks for its LL Y coordinate in map, if such Y exists, then searches through the corresponding value(set of rectangles), otherwise-it searches in a whole map.
Is there an effective algorithm to get needed results?

37554915,Keeping Track of Comparisons Performed in a Sort,"
I'm trying to track the amount of comparisons made for a simple c++ sorting function.
I was playing around with the value I thought might return the number of comparisons made, and thought at first perhaps the number of comparisons would be held in startScan. Of course it isn't, start scan will only hold ever hold a maximum of size-1. That's definitely not the number of comparisons made.
I thought perhaps it would be found in the variable index. So I created int temp = index; because I was lazy and didnt want to work it through, but sure enough when I returned the value of temp it was also just size-1. Don't know why I expected any different, but I thought I would try. 
Then I started thinking about it... do I even know where comparison is taking place? 
Turns out I don't know if I do or not. I figure all of my comparisons happen in the second for loop,
for (int index = startScan + 1; index < size; index++) and even then really just the if statement nested inside.
Anytime the if statement runs, it's comparing something. SWEET, I thought. So I created int temp = 0; at the top of my function, slapped a temp++ inside the if statement, and thought SURELY THIS WILL GIVE ME THE NUMBER OF COMPARISONS. 
It gave me an encouraging number this time. When sorting a random list of 13 numbers (random as in I picked random numbers) my temp returned a value of 18. That to me has no linear relation to any of my other numbers as far as I can tell.
So here's my real question. Does this work? Does my final code do what I want it to do, and indeed return the number of comparisons made? Or have I merely found yet another arbitrary number that I just so happen to like more than the other numbers yielded by my other tests. I have no idea how to manually count the number of comparisons. I like the number, but for all I know it could be way off.

37530411,Quicksort Partition Algorithm,"
I am trying to learn Quick Sort. To do so, I followed the logic for quick sort in this article where the last element is picked as the pivot and you work through the array from both ends swapping elements as needed. Now after a long time of trying to come up with my own algorithm based on this, here is what I have so far:
So after testing this with various arrays of different sizes and elements, it does output a correctly sorted array however in the algorithms that I have found online (ex. Hoare's) they always decrement right and increment left at the start of the partition. Also the pivot does not move in most algorithms I have found, but I move it. 
What I am wondering is, am I doing this wrong? Why does it work? It's been a lot of trial and error so that it be understandable if I did it wrong, I am also slightly new to algorithms and data structures so I wouldn't be surprised if I made some mistakes.

I tested it by using pseudo random numbers and it looks like it is doing its job - array is sorted at the end . I have some doubts as to the proper memory management. Exacly to the removing form queue and inserting it into the array.
There is first question: Are there any leaks of memory ?

I also tought about complexity of this algorithm. I read this artticle about efficiency.

n - size of array
w - number of positions in our max number
c1 = comparison in max function - done n times
c2 = insertion at queue - done n*w times
c3 = remove from queue - done n*w times
c4 = insertion at array - done n*w times
T(n) = nc1 + nw*(c2+c3+c4) = O(w*n)

Memory complexity will be T(n) = n * sizeof(node)

37433113,Thrust - sorting member arrays of class object on gpu,"
Currently I am working on porting a molecular dynamics simulation program, which was written in plain cpu C++, to Cuda. In short, the program initialises a list of atoms, transfers the control to an object of class CCalc which calculates atomic forces, velocities and positions for 100 (or another number of) iterations, and finally returns to draw the atoms on the screen.
My goal is to have all compute-heavy functions in CCalc run on the gpu. To prevent having to copy all calculation constants in CCalc one by one, I decided to copy the whole class to device memory, pointed to by this__d. Since the drawing function is called from the cpu, the atom list needs to be copied between cpu and gpu every 100 iterations and as such is not a member of CCalc.
In function CCalc::refreshCellList(), I want to rearrange atoms__d (the atom list residing in device memory) such that all atoms in the same cell are grouped together. In other words, atoms__d needs to be sorted with cellId as keys.
As I don't want to waste time implementing my own sorting algorithm, I tried using thrust::sort_by_key(). And here's where I got stuck. The function thrust::sort_by_key() requires device_ptr objects as arguments; however I cannot access cellId since I can only cast this__d to device_ptr, which I can't dereference on the cpu.
Is there a way to do this without having to break down the ""class on gpu"" structure?

37322047,Sort points in vector to form conture,"
I got a vector with n rows with xy coordinates of points. These points form a conture of an given CAD model. Now I want to restore the conture of the model. So I tried to sort the point with the atan2 function.
This is the code I use to sort the points.
So first I sort the points in the vector matrix. As compare function i use this code
After the vector has been sorted, I just delete duplicates to reduce the size of the vector. The last step is to push back the first point to the end of the vector to close the conture.
For standard models like a cube, or a ball this works fine, but for more complicate models the atan2 function is note working fine.
So this image show the unsorted points.

When I sort the vector I get this conture as result

My first approach was to check the atan2 function but it's working fine. The problem seem to be the result of the atan2 function. So this list shows the actual coordinates and the result of the atan2 function
As you can see while the x and y coordinate change the atan2 stays in the same range as the other values. For me that's the problem, why my conture isn't correct. Do I have to add something to my sort function to get the correct results? 
One idea i had was to sort the coordinates not just by the atan2, but also by the length of the vector between the point, with the lowest atan2, and all other points. But here's my problem. I would first sort by atan2, and then sort again by the length. But the second sort process would destroy the hole result of the first sort function.

If B were something sorted Descending like {100, 84, 74, 51, 5, 1} Then A will also be sorted Descending.

if (n==6 || n==8 || n==10 || n==12 || n==14 || n==16 || n==18 || n==20)
One possible simplification is to observe that the numbers a[]={6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20} form an arithmetic progression, so shifting the range and then using some bitwise tricks 
if (((n - 6) & 14) + 6 == n)
leads to a shorter (and probably indeed more efficient) implementation, as answered by John Bollinger.
Now I am asking what is the analogously elegant (and hopefully equally efficient) implementation of
if (n==3 || n==5 || n==11 || n==29 || n==83 || n==245 || n==731 || n==2189)
Hint: this time the numbers a[k] form a geometric progression: a[k]=2+3^k.
I guess in the general case one cannot do better than sort the numbers a[k] and then do a logarithmic search to test if n is a member of the sorted array.

38408192,Need help on figuring out what I did wrong in this Inversions algorithm (based on merge sort),"
The objective is to find the number of inversions in an array of integers. For example, 

given : (1,3,5,2,4,6)
the inversions are : (3,2) , (5,4) , (5,2).

That is, a total of three inversions. The O(n^2) solution requires two for loops but takes too long for a large input array. Since merge sort takes O(n(log(n))) time, it would make sense to implement it in this case. 
By the divide & conquer method, we can achieve O(n(log(n))). The solution would be the sum of the inversions taken. The inversions are as follows (for an input array of size 'n'):

left inversion if i,j <= n/2
right inversion if i,j > n/2 
split inversion if i <= n/2 < j

Note:Split inversions are done when arr[i] > arr[j] and i < j.
On the basis of the above claims, this is the following algorithm I wrote (in which I first wrote that of merge sort, then tweaked it accordingly to return the number of inversions) for which I am attaining a wrong output. I'm unable to figure out where I went wrong.

I'm trying to sort a 2D, dynamically allocated array using std::sort with a custom sorting function using lambda. numFaces is an integer value determined at the start of the program and doesn't change during the program's lifespan. Here's my current approach.
The program is failing to compile with this error:

array type 'float [24]' is not assignable

Since I've specified in the lambda declaration that the parameters should be references I can't see why the compiler is producing this error message. I am using the VC++ compiler from Microsoft's Visual Studio Community Edition 2015.
Here's a quick pastebin of the entire log
Line 38 is the closing bracket of the lambda function declaration.
I know I could solve this in a couple different ways, but if there is a way to make this work, I would prefer to continue like this. If you have a suggestion to another solution that lets the data be stored contiguously and sorted in these groups of 28 floats I would be delighted to hear about that too.
Ways I could solve the current issue which would introduce other issues and/or bigger delay in the application:

Using qsort with void pointers, casting them and sorting pretty much the same way. I'm a bit unsure whether or not this would introduce any more delay when the std::sort doesn't have all the information about the container that it would have if I was using std::vectors.
Using std::sort with nested std::vectors. The data wouldn't always be stored contiguously on memory, which would in turn force me to create copies of the data every time the vector is sorted. I tested this and checked the locations on memory with the VS debugger, but again I am not 100% sure this can't be solved somehow.
Using std::vector of a custom class/struct with the needed data. If there is no simple solution to my problem I will do this or do the sorting without any STL calls.

Tiny notice: The code in the code tag above has been stripped of unnecessary code. The pastebin is a bit different because of this.

A quick recap of the problem with a solution:
std::sort rearranges the elements of whatever you are sorting by assigning one element to another. Because of this the elements have to be assignable, which C-style arrays simply aren't. There are a number of ways to go about solving this, but if you need the data to be stored contiguously on memory you need a type holding exactly the data the array would be holding; no more, no less. std::array is the perfect type for this as people have pointed out in the comments. Here's an example solution:

I have been trying to solve this simple problem (http://br.spoj.com/problems/GENERAL/) on spoj for quite some time now, but I keep on getting TLE (Time limit exceeded) for some reason. 
Since the problem is in Portuguese, a brief description of the problem is like this (without the story): 

You are given an array of size N, you have to arrange the array in
  ascending order, such that an element can only be swapped with
  elements which are at a distance k from it. If the array can be
  sorted then print the number of swaps required to arrange them in
  ascending order, if it cannot be sorted print impossivel.

This is my code::
My logic : I perform N/k iterations on the array. I initialize the loop variable i to N. In each iteration I check i-k elements with the element at a distance k from it, if they are to be swapped then I swap them and increment the number of swaps needed, else I do nothing. Then I check the elements from i-k to i, if they are in ascending order, if not I break the loop and print ""impossivel"", else I change i to i-k and again perform the loop. By my logic after every iteration the last k elements will be in ascending order, if is possible to sort them, since at every step I move the elements which are greater to the right.
Does this seem correct to you? How can optimize this further? Thanks for any help in advance. :)

An N-element permutation is an N-element sequence of distinct numbers from the set {1, 2, ...,n}. For example the sequence 2,1,4,5,3 is a 5-element permutation. P is an N-element permutation. Your task is to sort P in ascending order. But because it is very simple, I have a new rule for you. You have two sequences P and Q. P is an N-element permutation and Q is initially empty and formed by sorting P (i.e. finally Q = 1, 2, 3,... , N). You have to implement N steps to sort P. In the i-th step, P has N-i+1 remaining elements, Q has i-1 elements and you have to choose some x-th element (from the N-i+1 available elements) of P and put it to the left or to the right of Q. The cost of this step is equal to x * i. The total cost is the sum of costs of individual steps. After N steps, Q must be an ascending sequence. Your task is to minimize the total cost.
Input
The first line of the input file is T (T ≤ 10), the number of test cases. Then descriptions of T test cases follow. The description of each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000). The second line contains N distinct integers from the set {1, 2, .., N}, the N-element permutation P.

For each test case your program should write one line, containing a single integer - the minimum total cost of sorting.

It looks like it moves the last number in the array to the front, and then does nothing. It does however appear to make 190 comparisons, although I don't particularly see the fruit of it's labor.

37690539,How to generate a list of ascending random integers,"
I have an external collection containing n elements that I want to select some number (k) of them at random, outputting the indices of those elements to some serialized data file. I want the indices to be output in strict ascending order, and for there to be no duplicates.   Both n and k may be quite large, and it is generally not feasible to simply store entire arrays in memory of that size.
The first algorithm I came up with was to pick a random number r[0] from 1 to n-k... and then pick a successive random numbers r[i] from r[i-1]+1 to n-k+i, only needing to store two entries for 'r' at any one time.  However, a fairly simple analysis reveals the the probability for selecting small numbers is inconsistent with what could have been if the entire set was equally distributed.   For example, if n was a billion and k was half a billion, the probability of selecting the first entry with the approach I've just described is very tiny (1 in half a billion),  where in actuality since half of the entries are being selected, the first should be selected 50% of the time.  Even if I use external sorting to sort k random numbers, I  would have to discard any duplicates, and try again.   As k approaches n, the number of retries would continue to grow, with no guarantee of termination.
I would like to find a O(k) or O(k log k) algorithm to do this, if it is at all possible.   The implementation language I will be using is C++11, but descriptions in pseudocode may still be helpful.

37646161,Radix Sorting algorithm difficulties,"
I'm having a problem understanding how to pass a user-input value as a parameter for a Radix Sorting algorithm.

My assignment class diagram is shown here. As you can see, the class constructor RadixSort is required to take (int radix) and (int exponent). The ""radix"" variable serves as the numerical base (i.e. base 10) and the ""exponent"" is used to sort all input numbers. 
My code works perfectly, except for one problem: it only works when I input the radix directly. Here are the important parts of my code:
From what I can tell, this is where things go wrong starting in the radixAlgorithm section: 

int count[10] = { 0 };

I'm supposed to be able to take the radix from user input. However, if I try to do that, making it into this: 

int count[radix] = { 0 }; 

I get this error:  

array type 'int[radix]' is not assignable. 
expression did not evaluate to a constant.

Because radix is supposed to be user input, and therefore not a constant, I dont understand how I could even use radix as the base of the count[ ] array.
Is there a better way to do this? Did I make it too complicated? I just dont understand how I'm supposed to perform the Radix Sort in any other way given that I'm forced to use the form 

RadixSort( int radix, int exponent); 

for the constructor. 
Any advice or improved methods?

39568403,C++ sort index file in-place (with heapsort),"
Updated Question:
Hi. I'm trying to sort a index file in-place. The file consits out of 14B data chunks and usually are too large to be loaded into the RAM. The first 8B are the bytes I want to sort after. I implemented a Heapsort algorithm which so far except for performance is working great!
I am wondering whether my implementation could be improved and how I could possibly speed this process up by using some RAM. I was thinking about possibly partially keeping the heap in RAM but I'm not sure on how that would work.
My code so far:
sortidx.h
sortidx.cpp
Original Question:
I hope you can help me out a little with a problem I have been stuck on quite some time.
I'm implementing a simple lookup table to quickly search a file. My current problem is the index file. Currently I'm iterating over the data file and create my index entries with 8 bytes of data that I'm going to look for followed by 6 bytes of data indicating the location of that data set in the original file. So my index file consits out of 14 byte blocks of data. Now I want to sort that file so I can easily find my data by doing binary search in the index file. That is the part where I'm struggeling so far.
I need to sort these 14 byte entries in-place by their first 8 bytes. Just sorting by the first 8 bytes shouldn't be too much of an issue. I'm rather puzzled over how I can sort the file itself.
I was thingking about either trying to implement a ""iterator"" class for the file so I could pass it to std::sort which should do the job fairly well. But since I'm not sure what interfaces I should provide for that to work and I also can't read the current progress I did some research and was reminded of the Heapsort algorithm which sounds extremly good since it has O(n*log(n)), is in-place and I can estimate the progress fairly well.
So far so good. I'm still a bit puzzeled over the actual implementation of this since I'm not sure what would be the best way of swapping several bytes of data in a file. Also I'm interested to hear whether you have alternative suggestions on how to sort this file since the index files are several GBs in size and performance matters a lot!

So in my code I get the xyz coordinates of points, which should form a contour. The problem is that this points aren't sorted in a correct way. When I get the coordinates They are sorted by rising x and y values. So first the x values are sorted, and if two points have the same x value they are sorted by their y value. The z value is always the same, so it can be ignored.
To sort the points to form the contour, I use a variation of the nearest neighbor algorithmen.
So here's my code for sorting:
So this works perfectly for standard contours, like a cube or a circle. But I also got contours, where this won't work.
So here's a picture of a unsorted contour

When I use the sorting code I provided I receive this result:

I already found the problem in the idea of my code. The contour is substantially longer than it is wide, thus the sorting algorithm is also always the nearest point on the wrong place.
So the correct picture would look like this:

My approach here was to start with one point, search for the nearest point and the follow the direction the points gave me. I did this all manually.
So my problem now is I don't know how to optimize my code so it follows a direction when sorting.

Edit: I just checked my code again. And I've seen that not the sort function is the problem. Since I have only numbers with one decimal place, I round the double values. For this I used the floor function.

38747694,What is slowing down sorting the pairs on a key?,"
Timing after implementing the accepted answer
Changing the lambda definition from:
to:
Cuts down the sorting time to 0.23 sec. This is still slightly slower than using sort, which is not surprising. Most of the strings with the same key are probably different already on the first character, and only 1/8 of all elements in the vector have keys that appear more than once anyway.
The original question
A toy problem from ""Programming Pearls"", finding anagrams in the English language. This is not homework, but you can treat the question as if it were. To solve this, I implemented the textbook solution:

Calculate a signature for each word in the dictionary (the word itself, sorted by characters)
Sort by signatures (all words are in {signature, word} pairs)
Output the runs with the same signature with length greater than 1.

This is of course trivial, to make it a bit more interesting I used the ICU library (with help from Roland Illig) so that the program doesn't choke up on non-ascii characters and could find anagrams in say Finnish.
Here follows the complete program. It is admittedly a bit long, but it is not easy to generate a realistic test input and output in less code.
This is the compiler I am using:
This is how I compile it:
And this is how I run it, also showing the timings:
clean-words are the words as found in /usr/share/dict/words, passed through the following:
In other words, get rid of the words with apostrophes, all capitals, and all capitalized duplicates.
We observe that sorting, using std::stable_sort and a lambda, is taking way too long. For comparison, if I sort on the whole pair, it takes about half that time. Changing, in the above program:
to:
Gives the following timings:
(0.51 sec to 0.22 sec)
Of course, the two sorts give identical results, because the words in the input file are already sorted. Notably, it is not a sort vs stable_sort issue. Using stable_sort (I know it is unnecessary with this input, but anyway), so changing to:
Changes the timings only minimally:
(0.22 sec to 0.26 sec)
While trying to figure out what is going on, I implemented the same algorithm in SWI-Prolog, and noticed that the built-in sort and keysort predicates show the expected difference, namely, sort needs longer than keysort. With the following implementation (again, the full program):
This is the Prolog I am using:
I ""compile"" the program (create a ""saved state"" for the interpreter):
And run it:
When I change
with
I get the following increased running time for the sorting:
(0.17 to 0.27 sec)
The final result of the sort is the same, but, as expected, sorting only by keys is considerably faster.
The question finally
What am I missing? Why is doing less costing more?

i need to find a fast way to remove duplicate vertices and faces of a mesh. 
The vertices and faces are stored in a Buffers, because I'm working with large data sets I use boost::shared_array<float> vertexBuffer and boost::shared_array<float> faceBuffer for the Buffers. 
Next I create a KD-Search-Tree and check for each point if it has a neighbour with dist(point, neighbour)<tollerance. If a neighbour is found i map the neigbour index to the point index in a unordered_map:
oldToNewID[neighbour_id]=point_id
Now i would like to move all vertices that are stored as value in the map to the end of the vertexbuffer. The problem here is that I need to also change the ID of the Face - Points.
For example:
VertexBuffer: 
FaceBuffer:
Now Vertex 0 and Vertex 2 are duplicate. So now i somehow have to change the VertexBuffer and FaceBuffer efficiantly so that i will result in:
Updated VertexBuffer: 
Updated FaceBuffer:
The duplicates should be moved to the back of the buffer and the faces that where referencing to Vertex 2 needed to be changed. Also each face refering to Vertex 3 and Vertex 4 must be updated because they changed their position.

38571955,Bitonic sort for key/value array,"
I'm trying to modify the Intel's Bitonic Sorting algorithm which sorts an array of cl_ints, to sort an array of cl_int2s (based on the key – i.e. cl_int2.x).
The Intel's example consists of a simple host code and one OpenCL kernel which is called multiple times during one sorting operation (multipass).
The kernel loads 4 array items at once as cl_int4 and operates on them.
I didn't modify the host code algorithm, only the device code. List of changes in the kernel function:

modify the first kernel's parameter type from int4* to int8* (to load four key-value pairs)
use only .even components of the theArray's elements to compare values (<)
create ""pseudomask"" (int4) and based on that, create mask as pseudomask.xxyyzzww (to capture the values)

Although the output of my modified kernel is perfectly sorted cl_int2 array by the first component (cl_int2.x), the values (cl_int2.y) are incorrect – the value of one item is repeated for the next 4 or 8 items and then new value is used and repeated...
I'm sure there's a trivial mistake, but I'm unable to find it.
Diff of the original Intel code and my modified version.
Edit: the cl_int2 array is sorted flawlessly when each key (cl_int2.x) is unique.

38539472,Counting the frequency of an elements in an array,"
Hello I am currently stuck on a homework problem as I have no idea how exactly to approach the problem.
Write a program that reads in a list of integers into an array with base type
int. Provide the facility to either read this array from the keyboard or
from a file, at the user’s option. If the user chooses file input, the program
should request a file name. You may assume that there are fewer than 50
entries in the array. Your program determines how many entries there are.
The output is to be a two-column list. The first column is a list of the distinct
array elements; the second column is the count of the number of
occurrences of each element. The list should be sorted on entries in the
first column, largest to smallest.
So I were to enter: 1, 2, 1, 10, 15, 12, 2, 10, 10
The program should output something like:
List Frequency
1-----2

Given a list of objects in a container that can not be modified 
/* It's a map<>. sort order is based on 'name' */
Need to get them ordered by the key. Which way is faster?
I can:

Insert them to std::set and then iterate over to get the order.
Per the C++ standard, iteration over the elements in an std::set proceeds in sorted order as determined by std::less or by the optional comparison predicate template argument.
Or insert them to an array, std::vector, and sort it. (expected std sort is O(n*log(n)) )
Can you think if any other faster way? In initial container they are sorted by name, which is irrelevant to the key index values.

Number of objects can be from 100 to 10000.
I think it is faster to use method 1. Even though the analysis below (if correct) indicates they have same complexity of O(n*log(n)).

40159342,Optimizing bubble sort - What am I missing?,"
I'm trying to understand possible optimization methods for the bubble sort algorithm. I know there are better sorting methods, but I'm just curious.
To test the efficiency I'm using std::chrono. The program sorts a 10000 number long int array 30 times and prints the average sorting time. The numbers are picked randomly(up to 10000) in every iteration. Here is the code, with no optimization:
I get 0.17 seconds average sorting time.
If I uncomment line 47(j--;) to avoid comparing numbers already sorted I get 0.12 sorting time which is understandable. 
If I remember the last position where a swap took place, I know that after that index, elements are sorted, and can thus sort up to that position in further iterations. It's better explained in the second part of this post: https://stackoverflow.com/a/16196115/1967496.
This is the code that implements the new possible optimization:
Note lines 40 and 48. And here comes the problem: The average time is now again around 0.17 seconds. 
Is there a problem in my code, or am I missing something ?
Update:
I did sorting with 10 times more numbers and get now following results:
No optimization: 19.3 seconds
First optimization(j--): 14.5 seconds
Second (supposed) optimization(j=last+1): 17.4 seconds;
From my understanding, the second method should be in any case better than the first, but the numbers tell something else.

40140310,Iterating through one variable in a vector of struct with lower/upper bound,"
I have 2 structs, one simply has 2 values:
And another that sorts the input element based on the index of the output element:
Using this:
What I'm trying to do with this, is iterate through the input varlable, and check if each element is equal to another input 'in'.
If it is equal, I want to insert the value at the same index it was found to be equal at for input, but from output into another temp vector.
I originally went with a more simple solution (when I wasn't using a structs and simply had 2 vectors, one input and one output) and had this in a function called copy:
Now this code did work exactly how I needed it, the only issue is it is simply too slow. It can handle 10 integer inputs, or 100 inputs but around 1000 it begins to slow down taking an extra 5 seconds or so, then at 10,000 it takes minutes, and you can forget about 100,000 or 1,000,000+ inputs. 
So, I asked how to speed it up on here (just the function iterator) and somebody suggested sorting the input vector which I did, implemented their suggestion of using upper/lower bound, changing my iterator to this:
And it worked, it made it much faster, I still would like it to be able to handle 1,000,000+ inputs in seconds but I'm not sure how to do that yet. 
I then realized that I can't have the input vector sorted, what if the inputs are something like:
Well then we have 10 in input corresponding to 1 in output, and -1 corresponding to 2. Obviously 10 doesn't come before -1 so sorting it smallest to largest doesn't really work here.
So I found a way to sort the input based on the output. So no matter how you organize input, the indexes match each other based on what order they were added.
My issue is, I have no clue how to iterate through just input with the same upper/lower bound iterator above. I can't seem to call upon just the input variable of myVector, I've tried something like:
But I get an error saying there is no member 'input'.
How can I iterate through just input so I can apply the upper/lower bound iterator to this new way with the structs?
Also I explained everything so everyone could get the best idea of what I have and what I'm trying to do, also maybe somebody could point me in a completely different direction that is fast enough to handle those millions of inputs. Keep in mind I'd prefer to stick with vectors because not doing so would involve me changing 2 other files to work with things that aren't vectors or lists.

Assuming I will modify the body of comparator accordingly.
If the first signature is mandatory, then why?
I want to understand reasons behind using const and reference'&'.
What I can think is const is because you don't want the comparator function to be able to modify the element. And reference is so that no multiple copies are created.

A [std::priority_queue] is a container adaptor that provides constant time lookup of the largest (by default) element, at the expense of logarithmic insertion and extraction.

Why is that? I think the sorting either happens on insertion or extraction.
For example, if the sorting happens on insertion and the internal container remains sorted, wouldn't the extraction be able to happen in constant time? The top element to be removed is know and so is the next smaller one.
However, both std::priority_queue::push and std::priority_queue::pop mention in their complexity descriptions:

Complexity
Logarithmic number of comparisons

Why would both have to perform comparisons? With an internal container that stays sorted, extraction should be easy or vice versa, with sorting upon extraction, insertion should be easy.

A char_ struct is created to store the individual characters(converted to to lowercase) and their difference from the uppercase equivalent(0 or 32, depending if the original char was lowercase or uppercase, respectively). It then sorts the char_ characters on the basis of their lowercase values. And after the sort we add back the difference to the character to retrieve the uppercase form. 
But when I try giving this string, it gives the following result.

39796452,Sort a set of coplanar 3d points in a desired order,"
I have a set of three-dimensional points that all lie in the same plane.  The points are simply ""x y z"" entries in a text file.  I would like to find a way to sort these points so that I could draw a simple polygon through all the points.  I had several ideas:
Idea 1: Pick a point known to lie inside the polygon that is defined by the set of points and draw a ray to an arbitrary point in the set.  Then use an angular function of some sort to find the closest point by angle to the first one, then so on for all the rest.  The problem with this idea is that I don't know how to find a point that is guaranteed to be inside the region.  I wanted to use the centroid, but not all of these sets are going to be convex.  They could look like either of the following two images:

As you can see in the second image, the centroid may not lie inside the polygon, and actually if the turning point is too steep in the corner there the angular function that I had in mind might not work either.
Idea 2: This seems like one of the easier problems that could be solved according to something like the Traveling Salesman problem.  But I know there are lots of different particular solutions and approximations to solving TSPs and I am a bit rusty on where to begin.
Idea 3: Use a simple distance function that would start with an arbitrary point and find the the point that is closest to it, then find the point (not one already found) closest to that and so on.  This seems like the easiest one to do but I wonder if I am not forseeing any problems that arise.
I would appreciate any input as to the best way to solve this, and whether I am overlooking an even simpler method.  I am programming this in C++ so another good answer would include libraries or functions that can do things like find a 3d centroid, or solve a TSP, etc.  Thanks in advance for your help.

In my code I get the coordinates of points stored in a vector called matrix.
The points aren't sorted, so I have to sort them. Since I do not know whether the contour forms a convex hull I have to modify the Graham scan. I decided to use the following procedure. First, I use to find the Graham scan to the convex hull.The hull I save in a new vector. Then I delete the points of the convex hull from the vector matrix. Then I have to sort the remaining points only in the new vector, for this I would use the distance and the dot product.
For this I have started the program Graham scan. I oriented myself at this link.
So here is what I have till now:
So in the function GeneratPath I want to sort the points. For this, I'll call the GrahamScan function which I pass the two vectors matrix and chull.In GrahamScan I first search the point with the lowest y-value using set_p0. Next I have to sort the points. Therefore I use the sort-function C++ provides. As argument I use the function compare_angle.

Since the function in my template to a struct-based I had to rewrite the function for my purposes. But if I now send forth program I get the error message: Expression: vector iterator + offset out of range.

Say I have an array of 4 different numbers.

How do you make a nested for loop in C++ to sort through these numbers from back to front in order to identify the required amount of digits needed for uniqueness?
From the example you can tell that you'll need 3 digits from the back to make sure no numbers contain similar tails of numbers. 50234, 50934 = 3 digits to have them unique = 502 and 509 respectively.
What would the for loop look like to go through each of these numbers one by one, number by number, and sort out identical numbers to reach an output of 3?
It would go like this:
4
6 - discard this number, it's not identical

40622430,`std::list<>::sort()` - why the sudden switch to top-down strategy?,"
I remember that since the beginning of times the most popular approach to implementing std::list<>::sort() was the classic Merge Sort algorithm implemented in bottom-up fashion (see also What makes the gcc std::list sort implementation so fast?). 
I remember seeing someone aptly refer to this strategy as ""onion chaining"" approach.
At least that's the way it is in GCC's implementation of C++ standard library (see, for example, here). And this is how it was in old Dimkumware's STL in MSVC version of standard library, as well as in all versions of MSVC all the way to VS2013. 
However, the standard library supplied with VS2015 suddenly no longer follows this sorting strategy. The library shipped with VS2015 uses a rather straightforward recursive implementation of top-down Merge Sort. This strikes me as strange, since top-down approach requires access to the mid-point of the list in order to split it in half. Since std::list<> does not support random access, the only way to find that mid-point is to literally iterate through half of the list. Also, at the very beginning it is necessary to know the total number of elements in the list (which was not necessarily an O(1) operation before C++11).
Nevertheless, std::list<>::sort() in VS2015 does exactly that. Here's an excerpt from that implementation that locates the mid-point and performs recursive calls
As you can see, they just nonchalantly use std::next to walk through the first half of the list and arrive at _Mid iterator.
What could be the reason behind this switch, I wonder? All I see is a seemingly obvious inefficiency of repetitive calls to std::next at each level of recursion. Naive logic says that this is slower. If they are willing to pay this kind of price, they probably expect to get something in return. What are they getting then? I don't immediately see this algorithm as having better cache behavior (compared to the original bottom-up approach). I don't immediately see it as behaving better on pre-sorted sequences.
Granted, since C++11 std::list<> is basically required to store its element count, which makes the above slightly more efficient, since we always know the element count in advance. But that still does not seem to be enough to justify the sequential scan on each level of recursion.
(Admittedly, I haven't tried to race the implementations against each other. Maybe there are some surprises there.)

40442365,Iterative mergesort from index a to index b,"
I'm trying to get some sort of mergesort going where it'll be like mergesort(int[] a, int start, int stop) where the start is the index to start sorting from and the stop is the index to stop sorting. The idea is that I can have 4 different threads sorting 4 subsections of the array at the same time. So I can call something like mergesort(a, 0, length/4); mergesort(a, length/4, length/2); mergesort(a, length/2, (3/4)*length); etc. all on different threads.
I've come across a bunch of iterative algorithms that go from 0 to length but when I edit those a bit to try to get them to work with subsections of the array I get segfaults on inputs that are too large and a bunch of silent errors when looking in Valgrind.
Here's what I have right now: 
The output is a sorted array if it doesn't segfault. However with valgrind there is always one instance of this ""Invalid write of size 4"" error: https://puu.sh/s7zb2.png
Here's the merge function I'm using:
What's going wrong? I have a feeling it's cause of the merge function trying to access a value it's not supposed to, but I can't seem to locate where this is happening.

40394199,Improve searching through unsorted list,"
My code spends 40% of its time searching through unsorted vectors. More specifically, the searching function my_search repeatedly receives a single unsorted vector of length N, where N can take any values between 10 and 100,000. The weights associated with each element have relatively little variance (e.g. [ 0.8, 0.81, 0.85, 0.78, 0.8, 0.7, 0.84, 0.82, ...]).
The algorithm my_search starts by summing all the weights for each object and then sample an average of N elements (as many as the length of the vector) with replacements. The algorithm is quite similar to 
from this post.
I could sort the vector before searching but takes a time of the order of O(N log N) (depending on the sort algorithm used) and I doubt (but might be wrong as I haven't tried) that I would gain much time especially as the weights have little variance.
Another solution would be to store information of how much weight there is before a series of points. For example, while summing the vector, every N/10 elements, I could store the information of how much weights has been summed yet. Then, I could first compare rnd to these 10 breakpoints and search in only a tenth of the total length of the vector.

Would this be a good solution?
Is there a name for the process I described?
How can I estimate what is the right number of breakpoints to store as a function of N?
Is there a better solution?

If we do it using the Most Significant Digit method, we can start by creating buckets 1 to 9 and divide the numbers up into the buckets using their MSD. 
You could sort this in parallel by having 1 thread per bucket. 
However if we had to do it with a given number of processors, say 4, how would you split those 9 buckets up into four processors?
A diagram that I saw online seemed to suggest that you would begin by dividing the numbers into x number of partitions for the x processors (without doing any sorting) and then each processor sorts all the numbers for their given partition. But then you would be left with x number buckets each sorted by itself, but not the entire vector/array of numbers sorted, and I'm not sure what you would do next.

so the array elements sort from: .4 .5 .1 .2 .3

the code is semantically identical to the working C++ code,
yet — the first entry doesnt sort, the last is repeated, 
and the high move is LOST.  :-(
seeing how in C++ log we get: J=3, i=1 > break
and in swift log it goes: J=3, i=1.. i=0 > break
leads me to think the problem is with the way swift is unwrapping array values passed by reference when being compared in the IF condition. 
an hour of research reveals that: 
this changes is Swift 3: 
    | In Swift 3 prefix the return type with inout [DONE]
so my question is the error here in swift unwrapping: moves[i].capturedPiece!
when doing the:  IF (moves![i] >= tempMove) {break} ??

I have this function we wrote some time ago:

C is a container of T elements
TimeUnit is a class encapsulating date and time
T is an object with a TimeUnit information

This function does a binary search (using std::lower_bound) in the container to find the closest object to now.
As we do a binary search, the container must be sorted. This function is used with many kind of containers (C can be std::vector, std::set, std::map...) in many places. Sometimes we use sorted std::vector rather than std::set because their memory management is faster and also for historical issue and compatibility with other piece of your code which is using vectors.
Problem is that I found a place in the code where a developer called findClosestObject with a container that was not sorted....nice bug...and I cannot safely identify all places where this could have been done.
So I now need to prevent that by sorting the container in this specific case where it's not (will be slow but will at least work and guarantee function returns what we want it to return)
So I tried to modify my function:
But this fails to compile when C is a std::set or a std::map. Because std::sort is not allowed for those kind of containers...
Can fixOrder be written in such a way that it would only do things for std::vector and not for other containers?

41129442,Branchless internal merge slower than internal merge with branch,"
I recently asked a question on Code Review to review a sorting algorithm named QuickMergeSort. I won't get in the details, but at some point the algorithm performs an internal mergesort: instead of using additional memory to store the data to merge, it swaps the elements to merge with elements from another part of the original sequence, which isn't otherwise concerned by the merge. Here is the part of the algorithm I'm concerned with: the function that performs the merging:
That function was adapted from the eponym function in libc++ implementation of std::inplace_merge; this new version swaps elements with another part of the original array instead of moving elements from the auxiliary array.
Since the merge is internal, I realized that I didn't actually need to have two separate input types: InputIterator1 and InputIterator2 are always the same. Then I came to realize that, since the operations on first1 and first2 were always the same, I could store them in a two-element array and use the result of the comparison to index the array to know which iterator to swap and to increment. With that small trick, I get rid of the branch and obtain a mostly branchless merge algorithm:
Now, the thing is: with this new half_inplace_merge function, the overall sorting algorithm is 1.5 times slower than with the original half_inplace_merge, and I've got no idea why. I've tried several compiler optimization levels, several tricks to avoid potential aliasing problems, but it seems that the problem comes from the branchless trick itself.
So, is anybody able to explain why the branchless code is slower?

Addendum: for those who want to run the same benchmark as I did... well, it will be a bit difficult: I used the benchmarks from a personal library, which include many things; you'll need to download the library, to add this file somewhere, and to run this benchmark after having added the required line to invoke quick_merge_sort near the highlighted section (you will need to redirect the standard output of the program to a file in a profiles subdirectory).

I have to form groups of size M having equal height buildings. Given, I can destroy buildings of greater height to make their height equal to the smaller buildings.
I have to find the minimum number of buildings to be destroyed so as to form exactly N/M groups.Given,N is always divisible by M.
for eg:
N=8,M=4
Height of buildings: 6 4 5 1 5 2 3 2
Answer:5
We can destroy two building of height 5's to two 2's to form the first group and then destroy building of height 3,4,6 to height 1 to form second group having buildings of equal height 1.
So, we form 2(N/M) groups of size 4(M).Minimum number of buildings to be destroyed are 5.
N=8,M=4
Height Of Buildings: 1 1 1 2 4 4 4 4

When I input a string that starts with the letter 'a' the program fails to check for that letter and excludes it. If i input a string that has an 'a' just not first in string, it checks out.
Here is the complete problem:
Write a program that will read a line of text and output a list of all the letters that occur in the text together with the number of times each letter occurs in the line. End the line with a period that serves as a sentinel value or delimiting character. 
The letters should be listed in the following order: the most frequently occurring letter, the next most frequently occurring letter, and so forth. 
Use two arrays, one to hold letters and one to hold integers. You may assume that the input uses all lowercase letters. For example, the input do be go bo. Should produce output similar to the following:
Letter Numbers of Occurrence
o 3
b 2
d 1

I want to make a function in C++ that receives a vector of indices (zero-based), idx of length n, and return the sorted elements from the binary file taken at the indices.
Example:
The 0th element is 2, the 5th element is 1, and the 8th element is 5. Variable idx is always sorted, but the saved array is not sorted. The length of idx is about 1% of N and typical value of N is 10,000.

Some of my ideas are:

put the new element into the correct position directly (i.e. after reading an element from the file, do binary search for the new element, and put the new element on that position), but this will run in O(n^2) time (as one insertion needs O(n) time)
create an empty array of size N, flag the position of the new element, and at the end pull out the elements from the array which is non-zero, this will run in O(N) time.

41651634,Is it better to sort from server and distribute to clients or send unsorted and let clients sort it?,"
This is an online game and I was paid to implement a game event, which is a  Player versus Player game system.
In my design I have a server side class (named PvpEventManager which is the event manager and it processes when a player kills another one, when a player joins or leaves the event, be it by decision, by being disconnected...etc, and has  many other functions. 
Now, this class also holds a container with the player information during the event (named vPlayerInfo), for all kinds of processing. When a player kills someone else, his kill must be increased and the victim's death too, quite obviously. But it also happens that clients have a scoreboard and since it's the server job to process a kill and tell all other clients connected on the event about this, the container will get updated. 
It is necessary that the container be sorted from kill struct member from ascending to descending order so that the scoreboard can be rendered (at client) properly.
What would be better?

To sort the container at server increasing server work and send the already-sorted ready-to-render-at-screen container to all clients.
To send the container unsorted and let every connected game client sort the container itself when receiving it.

Note that the server processes thousands of thousands of packets incoming and outcoming every tick and really processes A LOT, A LOT of other stuff. 
This somewhat describes the design of it:

This code describes what is being done when sorting the container on part of the actual code.

I wanted to do an implementation of Merge Sort in C++. I didn't look at concrete examples because I wanted to try out for myself. And here is what I came up with using vectors:
a is a pointer to the vector and n is the length of the same vector. I had quite a lot of trouble in the merging because it would leave the vector and start using 0.

Suppose I have a vector<vector<int>> L with N vectors, and total number of ints summed across all vectors is at most M. What is the tightest time complexity of the standard C++ sort sort(L.begin(), L.end())?
The vector<int> comparison function has runtime at most O(M), so an obvious bound is O(NM log N). But if we implement standard mergesort, we can see that in each of the O(log N) levels at most O(M) integer comparisons are done, so the runtime is O((N+M) log N). This is because comparing two vectors of length A and B takes O(min(A,B)) time.
Does the C++ standard guarantee that the runtime is O((N+M) log N)?

41524454,Interruptible sort function,"
In my application I need to sort a rather large array, which turns out to be a standard task using, e.g. std::sort.
Being situated in a GUI application I'd like to give some sort of response on the progress of the sorting. My first attempt is to figure out the approximate number of comparisons needed (n*log2(n) for std::sort) and then simply counting them in the comparison functor passed to std::sort. This works quite well.
The sorting algorithm is executed in a separate thread to keep the GUI responsive. It communicates its progress to the GUI using Qt's signals or some similar thread safe mechanism.
However, I'd also like to have the sort operation interruptible. That is, the user is provided a button or something similar to abort the whole operation. At the moment I only see two options:

Preemptively terminate the thread (pthread_cancel etc.)
rewrite the sorting algorithm and insert explicit cancellation points.

Considering thread cancellation rather as a last resort and refusing to rewrite standard library algorithms, I'm holding the wolf by the ears.

41517882,C++ sort with 'tweaked' compare functor,"
I have a class functor (too complex to implement as a lambda), but to strip the idea down, I want to ensure the functor satisfies the Compare predicate. The issue is, I want all values larger than (1) to yield ascending order, but to place all values of (1) at the 'end' - e.g., treated as 'larger' values.
e.g., {2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, ..., 1, 1, 1}
The function object is implemented as a struct to extract arguments from a (complicated) object reference it is constructed with, but the important part is the method in the function object. To simplify:
This appears to work as expected with std::sort and std::stable_sort. But, I'm still not convinced it correctly satisfies the criteria for Compare, in terms of strict weak ordering. Note that x <= 1 in all cases - that is, for: i, j >= 1. Clearly, (1, 1) => false
Is my 'tweaked' functor correct, even as it places values of (1) at the end? That is (1) has been handled to be interpreted as greater than values x > 1? Or have I just been lucky with my sort implementations?

As I should have clarified, the value (0) does not occur. I originally had this in a comment for the (very clever) accepted answer but mistakenly deleted it.

I have been trying a sorting method in which I subtract each number stored in an array by other elements in the same array. Then, I saw a pattern that the number of differences which come to be negative, is the rank or position of element in the Sorted one. But, things go wrong when I am using repeated entries.
My basic method is :
Take every element of the SampleArray.
subtract it from every element of the SampleArray
check if the difference comes to be negative.
if it is then, increase a variable called counter.
And use this counter as the position of element in sorted array.
For example: lets take (5,2,6,4)
first take 5, subtract it from each of the numbers which will give results (0,-3,1,-1), so counter will become 2, which will be the index of 5 in the sorted Array. And repeat it for each of the elements.
for 5, counter will be 2.
for 2, counter will be 0.
for 6, counter will be 3.
for 4, counter will be 1.
And hence the sorted Array will be {2,4,5,6}. 
First, see the code : 
Now, if we run this program with entries with no repetitions then, it sorts out the array, But if we use repeated entries like
the tempArray gets its first element as 2 as counter will be zero.
the tempArray gets its second element as 4 as counter will be 1.
but, the tempArray can't get its third one as counter will be still 1, and thus prints some randomNo in place of this. (here the things go wrong).

Imagine that you're working at a car wash and your task is to manage the order of which cars that should be washed first. Each car will have two numbers:

A priority value between 1-100.

The arrival value describes the time in minutes when the car arrived at the queue, it takes exactly 5 minutes to wash one car, and only 1 car can be washed at the same time.
You'll not follow the order in the queue, instead you'll always choose the car in the queue with the lowest priority. If the washing team isn't busy, you'll pick the car with the lowest priority. As soon as the washing team is ready, you'll pick the next car with the lowest priority.
Now we want to write a program that takes a list of all cars and prints the order (the cars priority value) that the cars should have been picked in.
The input will look like this:
Where a is the priority value, b is the arrival value and c is the amount of cars. The list will always be sorted in ascending order for the value b, and the first b will always be 0.

What I currently do is to sort the priority values with bucket sort (1 to 100), and then loop through all buckets and pick the first car that satisfies the arrival condition (arrival <= time) each time until all buckets are empty. Each time I pick a car, I also increase a variable time by 5, to keep track of which cars that can be chosen in the next turn. I also keep track of the lowest arrival value to come, and assign time to that value if no cars where found, so that the loop doesn't get stuck if the difference in arrival time is greater than 5.
Question
If we call the amount of cars C and the amount of buckets are 100 (because of index 1 to 100), the above mentioned solution runs in O(C + 100C) in the worst case. If I run this in C++ and set C to 20000 it results in a running time of around 10-15ms.
So, my question is if it's possible to optimize this further so that we get a solution that has a better time complexity, for instance O(C) or atleast O(50C)? The goal is to get a running time of 0-4ms.

Suggestions
Priority Queue:
Unfortunately this implementation still requires 10-15ms to process 20000 cars.
Taking advantage of cars being already sorted:

I am making a sorted linked list where the user enters a number and the number is inserted into sorted position. I am currently having problems with the sort function.
I decided to go with an insert function(its called sort but really it just inserts a node into the linked list) which is why i have a current pointer and a previous pointer.

Suppose, a contiguous array of following type has to be sorted:
With aforementioned operator<, it creates following sorted array: 
What is the best way to write the comparator, so that it creates following sorted array:
As you may see, the array is specially sorted where the parent_id creates a grouping & then based on the lowest to highest value, the array is arranged. In other words, the latest dependent (those X, who have non-empty parent_id) objects are the key players. Remaining parents are pulled to them.
My effort: The natural way to do this is:

Perform sorting with the aforementioned comparator
Iterate from the bottom/reverse, i.e. the highest value
Look for parent_id for element x; if valid then:  


search for the parent_id, copy & erase that element   
insert just above x

Recursively execute step 3 until parent_id not found

Hi i have a problem with my code, i try sort array by counting sort (it must be stable sort), but my code doesn't work. I try implemented counting-sort from some wbesite, but it was in c# and I'm not sure s it done correctly. Can you tell me what is wrong with it?

43246218,sort strings in alphabetical order with linked lists in c++,"
I am doing an assignment of linked list of strings. Everything seems to work fine until I get to the sorting part. I am using classes as well. I already have 2 functions. The first one minimum(string) where it returns the string that would come first in alphabetical order.
This functions works fine. I also have a function remove(string) where it removes a node containing the given string from the linked list. It returns true if successful, otherwise false (if string was not in the list), in this case I have to erase the string returned by the minimum(string) function. The function I am having trouble is sort().
It wants me to define a StringNode pointer to be the head of a new list (the empty list) then I need a loop where I will call the functions of minimum(string) and remove(string). Inside the loop I also need to insert this node into the proper position in the new list (append it to the end). The old head pointer (now empty) must point to the new list.
I am very confused about this, so far I have this:
How I understand is: I need to create  a new node which will be an empty list meaning newList->next = NULL; then on the loop I need to create another new node, and a pointer that will point to the head of new node inside the loop. I need to make the value given by the minimum be stored in the pointer p and the pointer to point back to the new node. 
Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I am writing a class to test the efficient of different sorting algorithms (for a college course), and of the algorithms I'm supposed to test is the STL sort. To measure efficiency, we've defined a class Integer that holds and integer value, and also allows us to increment a global variable each time it is compared or assigned. I then have a driver class which tests the std::sort call on multiple vectors of integers. I have overloaded the '<' operator in my Integer class, and it conforms to strict weak ordering (at least I'm pretty sure it does). Every time I call sort, however, I get a segmentation fault. I really can't figure out why this is happening, any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

42989312,Fastest way to search in sorted static array,"
I am looking for the fastest way to search in a sorted, fixed array of 32 bit keys. The array size and data is static and will never change. The size of this array is ~1000-10000 unique elements. The search range is significantly broader (~100000) so a lot of searched values will not be found. I am interested in exact matches only.
Here is how the search proceeds:

Generate ~100 keys. These keys are in order of relevance so they can't be simply sorted
Search for the set of ~100 keys in a collection of static arrays (typically between 50 and 300 of them)
Stop the search when we have found enough matching results (hence the importance of not sorting the keys to get the most relevant results)

A potentially interesting property of the keys is that even if they are not close in term of integer value, most of them will only have a few different bits (~1-4) from their closest neighbor.
Most answers I found point towards binary search but none deal with the case of a static array, which probably opens up some optimization possibilities.
I have full control over the data structure, right now it is a fixed, sorted array but I could change that if it's not optimal. I could also add precomputed information since the data doesn't change if it doesn't take an unreasonable amount of memory.
The goal is to be efficient both in CPU and memory although CPU is the priority here.
Using C++ although that probably won't affect the answer much.

42915772,What's the most performant way to create a sorted copy of a C++ vector?,"
Given a C++ vector (let's say it's of doubles, and let's call it unsorted), what is the most performant way to create a new vector sorted which contains a sorted copy of unsorted?
Consider the following naïve solution:
This solution has two steps:

Create an entire copy of unsorted.
Sort it.

However, there is potentially a lot of wasted effort in the initial copy of step 1, particularly for a large vector that is (for example) already mostly sorted. 
Were I writing this code by hand, I could combine the first pass of my sorting algorithm with step 1, by having the first pass read the values from the unsorted vector while writing them, partially sorted as necessary, into sorted. Depending on the algorithm, subsequent steps might then work just with the data in sorted.
Is there a way to do such a thing with the C++ standard library, Boost, or a third-party cross-platform library?
One important point would be to ensure that the memory for the sorted C++ vector isn't needlessly initialized to zeroes before the sorting begins. Many sorting algorithms would require immediate random-write access to the sorted vector, so using reserve() and push_back() won't work for that first pass, yet resize() would waste time initializing the vector.

Edit: As the answers and comments don't necessarily see why the ""naïve solution"" is inefficient, consider the case where the unsorted array is in fact already in sorted order (or just needs a single swap to become sorted). In that case, regardless of the sort algorithm, with the naïve solution every value will need to be read at least twice--once while copying, and once while sorting. But with a copy-while-sorting solution, the number of reads could potentially be halved, and thus the performance approximately doubled. A similar situation arises, regardless of the data in unsorted, when using sorting algorithms that are more performant than std::sort (which may be O(n) rather than O(n log n)).

Sort by decimal digits, which makes 10 buckets (0 to 9).

I don't see which of the two would be more efficient however. Sorting in only 2 buckets seems to be quite inefficient, but using decimal digits means the fast bitwise operators can't be used and instead I have to use the especially slow % and / operators.

The output would be the velocity measured at the nearest point available. Since I have four vectors x, y, z and V, the program will look for the nearest node, lets say it is x[5239], y[5239], z[5239] (which corresponds to x=.501 y=.299 z=.1), and output V[5239].
I was thinking of setting a couple of reference points (let's call them p and q). And my idea is to compute the distance of all the nodes with respect to to p and q. Then sort the vectors according to the node's distance to p and q (for that I would need to keep a reference of the original index, in order to be able to find V[i]). After that I could use a binary search, using the distance of the given point with respect to p and q to find the nearest node.
Another thing I found that could be useful would be hash tables. Which one would be more efficient if the number of elements in my vectors is ~96,000 and the number of interpolations I have to perform may be also that many.
How would I go about keeping an eye to the indexes (like the matlab sort function). Also what kind of sorting algorithm would you recommend in this case?

I just want to find same values between groups in two arrays. (Will you recommend me to use data ordering first to reduce the number of comparison? ).
In order to solve this problem, should I use ‘std::map’ for data clustering, and compare those N! times (N: no. of groups in array 1 or 2)? Is this best way that I can do? 
I’d like to get your advice. Thank you for sharing my problems.

My conclusion
My approach is to use map container in C++ STL.

Make 2 map containers (Array1_map, Array2_map).
Insert value of each array into the map containers as a key, and insert index of each array into the map as a value. (Two data of both arrays are orderly saved in a map without duplication.)
Use find() member function of map container for data matching. 
After data matching, I was able to get the indexes of each array which have the matched keys (corresponding keys).

42721344,Naive vector swapping only partially working,"
I have a paired vector <string,int>pairedv containing data measurement names and indices.  The size, at least of the test data, is around 780 measurements, approximately half water, half other liquid.  Because I want the file output from this program to be as user-friendly as possible, I'm trying to presort the output into two sections, a water section and ""other"" section.
In the final loop of the code below, I have a bool vector mask for when its corresponding measurement name doesn't contain ""water"" or any common variant.  If bool[i] returns true, it increments a counter to be used later, else it finds the next ""water"" measurement, and switches the values for the two elements. 


If I run this last loop twice, it does sort the water measurements before the ""not water"" measurements.  However, this is definitely a sub-optimal solution; what can I do to sort in one pass?

Then use the alphabetical order as an index, and add one to that index in an array of 26 integers.

So in short: it records the frequency of characters in a string and adds it to an array of integers, so if I input ""ABC"" it will output 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, etc, or if I input ""XXYZZ"" it will output ...0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2.

I can reduce the complexity further by sorting the array in the beginning and eliminating the values > k. But this is useful only in couple of scenarios and not the general solution of optimization.

first we define a < operator in the object, then make a function along the following lines:

Now, and this is where it gets tricky: what if we want to sort a vector of pointers to any type, with any arbitrary compare function (we make the assumption that whatever type we use that function with, will be able to work with it)- supplying a template version of the sort_helper function above is easy:

43860495,Correctly measuring constituent fundamental operations in sorting,"
I am trying to add some telemetry to the sorting functions in the standard library. I want to count the number of swaps, moves (including the ones invoked by the swap), and comparisons operations in the std::sort() and std::stable_sort() functions.
In order to do so, I am taking the following steps:

Create a struct to encapsulate the counts of the operations I want to measure
Create a wrapper for the comparison function object to increment the comparison count 
Specialize the std::swap() function and increment the swap count
Create a custom move function and invoke that from the specialized std::swap() function created in step #3
Finally, run std::sort() and std::stable_sort() and gather stats

I get the following output, which may be correct because the std::stable_sort() is not likely to invoke any swaps:
However, if I replace #4 step above with this:

Specialize the std::move() function and increment the move count

The output has 0 moves for std::sort(), which is definitely not right:
Furthermore, my compiler's (LLVM 8.1.0 on Darwin 16.5.0) implementation of std::stable_sort() is ridden with move() calls. So, I am also expecting non-zero move count in the output.
Please take a look at my code below (MVCE for the first case followed by the excerpt for the second/broken case) and see if you can answer these questions:

Is my overall approach for stats collection reasonable?
Why is the second case broken and how may I fix it?

43774977,Modify sorted array or sort the array everytime?,"
Problem: Given an array of size N, print the sorted sub sets of size K with consecutive elements.
Approach 1: Sort all the sub sets and print. 
Complexity Analysis:
Copy K elements: O((N - K + 1) * (K)) // No of sub sets * size of sub sets
Sort sub set: Using STL, the worst case time to sort a sub set is O(K log K).
Thus,  O((N - K + 1) * (K) + (N - K + 1) * (K log K))
Approach 2: From the output sequence, the consecutive sub sets differ by 2 elements. Therefore for the second sub set, Delete the first element and insert the K + 1 th element at the right position.
Complexity Analysis:
Create the first sub set: K
Remove and Insert - linear search (Should this be optimized!): K 
Thus, O(K + (N - K + 1) * (K))
I would like to know if the second approach is faster? Is there a significant gain? Is it worthy of not using the STL implementation? Can this be further improved? Is there any other approach? and any suggestions for STL containers for implementation.

Given two or more arrays, how can I choose to sort one array and sort the others accordingly? This is similar to sorting a table by one column.
Below are some strategies I came up with. I hope you can give me some hints into the right direction. Thank you!
Strategy 1: 

Make a struct struct sortstruct{int i; double d; std::string s};
Create vector and copy values inside
Write a predicate function and use std::sort
Copy values back into original structure.

This seems to be quite easy but also this involves duplicating all data twice and also creates a lot of small objects if the arrays are large. Also, this is not flexible if the number of arrays varies.
Strategy 2:

Make a copy of the array to sort with.
Sort the copy using std::sort.
Move through the sorted copy and for each value, find the value in the original array, then swap the index positions in all value arrays.

Also quite easy to implement, but finding the value in the unsorted array takes quadratic time (linear time for each value).
Strategy 3:

Implement a custom sorting algorithm which takes a ""key"" array and applies all swaps to the other arrays.

I don't like that I have to do the sorting by myself. But this is of course no problem if this is the best strategy.

43511462,Sorting a vector of object pointers,"
I'm writing a GradeBook class with a vector of pointers to StudentInfo class objects std::vector <StudentInfo*> students; and I would like to sort it using the <algorithm> sort function and evaluating each object by its string data member StudentID. From other posts here on stack overflow, I feel like I got the gist of what I need to do.
First I overloaded the operator< in StudentInfo:
This seems to work correctly.
Then I defined a comparison function in my GradeBook class:
Again this seems to work fine when I try it independently.
What seems to throw me is when I then try to use the sort function with the CompareStudents function as a third argument to tell it to how to compare the pointers to objects (using the StudentID data member).
I've found several examples on stack overflow and elsewhere that seem similar, but I must be doing something wrong, because I keep getting errors:
If I leave off the CompareStudents part and just write sort(students.begin(), students.end()) it runs okay, but is just comparing pointers which is not the behavior I want.
I'm running Visual Studio Community 2015, if that matters. If this is confusing I can post my whole .h and .cpp files.

I have encountered one coding problem regarding sorting a 2D vector (matrix) using a desired criteria using std::sort from library algorithm

So after sorting I want to have a matrix: 
I know that in order to specify sorting criteria in std::sort, third function needs to be sent in std::sort. If it were a 1D vector it would not be a problem. I would make a lambda inside std::sort with 2 parameters, compare them and return true/false.
So now you can see the problem I am facing, how can I access specific elements inside a matrix, in my case third column elements and compare them with std::sort?

43437958,std::sort by unary mapping,"
The C++ standard library offers to pass a Comparator to std::sort. However, I have many cases in my code where I want to sort a list of T objects by a function f. A comparator like this would be a valid option:
This is not optimal though. f is slow to evaluate but will return the same value for every call with the same T object. So what I would rather do is compute f once for every object in the range and then use those results to sort them.
My goal is to write this function (which I have not been able to do):
Such that after this call, f(*iter) <= f(*std::next(iter)) for all iter in the sequence left to right. 
Furthermore, the function should satisfy these requirements:

Does not allocate any additional objects of type T.
Evaluates f exactly std::distance(left, right) many times.
Maintains the overall complexity of O(n log n).
Should be implemented in terms of std::sort. Of course I could solve this problem by implementing my own merge sort but that is something I would like to avoid.

45108935,Greedily assigning scores to maximize the final result,"
You are given a time line of T days and a list of N scores. You have to assign each score to a day(among 1 to T) such that the total assigned score maximizes.
Although there are restrictions. Each score can be assigned to only a limited number of days X and also can be assigned to days occuring on or  after a particular number Y.
Input is in the given Format :
T
N
Score X Y (150 4 1 means Score 150 can be assigned to atmost 4 days on or after day 1)
For eg : 
Note = 2 Scores can have same value . Each day can be assigned at most 1 score.
The optimum result for above example would be : 150 150 150 150 120 120 200 200 120 120.
What i tried :
I sorted the list according to the scores and started assigning the highest scores first. 
In the above example I would start with 200 and assign it to 7 and 8 days.
Similarly I would assign the next highest score 150 to 1,2,3 and 4 days.
and so on ...
But this would take O(N * T) time. N for iterting over list of scores and T for checking and assigning scores over the time line(in the worst case).
The goal is to maximise and calculate the final score.
Is there a more elegant way to do this? Like without even assigning the scores and thus doing away with the T part of O(N * T).
",1
45099645,Maximizing score by scheduling tasks,"
So we have a timeline of T days in which some tasks have to be performed.
Every task has a penalty score. If the task is not performed in the given timeline , it's score adds up in the final penalty score. Every task can be performed only after it's given starting time.
The input will be given in the format:
T
Score Quantity_of_task  Starting_time
For eg :
T = 10   
140 5 4 
This means that 5 tasks with penalty score 140 have to be performed from 4th day onwards.
You can perform at most 1 task on a particular day.
The goal is to minimize the final penalty score.
What I tried to do:
I sorted the list according to the penalty score , and greedily assigned the tasks with high penalty score to their corresponding days,i.e
2 tasks with highest score 200 are assigned to days 7 and 8
4 tasks with next highest score 150 are assigned to 1,2,3,4 days 
4 tasks with next highest score 120 are assigned to 5,6,9,10 days
which gives the schedule as
150 150 150 150 120 120 200 200 120 120
Left out tasks:
10 tasks with 100 score = 1000 penalty
5 tasks with 50 score = 250 penalty
Final penalty = 1250.
This requires O(T * input_size). Is there a more elegant and optimized way of doing it?
Both input size and T have a constraint of 10^5.
Thanks.

44984485,Why is traversing more time-consuming than merging on two sorted std::list?,"
I am pretty amazed on the result that traversing takes more time than merging on two sorted std::list by around 12%. Since merging can be considered and implemented as continuous element comparisons, list splice and iterators traversal through two separated sorted linked lists. Hence, traversing should not be slower than merging through them especially when two lists are large enough because the ratio of iterated elements is getting increased.
However, the result seems to not match what I thought, and this is how I test my ideas above:
PS. icc is smart enough to eliminate Option 2. Try sum += num; and print out sum.
This is the output from perf: (the measured time remains the same without using perf)
Option 1: Merge
Option 2: Traverse
Due to the property of horrible spatial locality on these linked lists. The cache miss is the major reason that make CPU stalls, and occupies most of the CPU resources. The strange point is that option 2 has fewer cache misses than option 1, but it has a higher amount of CPU stalls and CPU cycles to accomplish its task. What makes this abnormality happen?

I wish to make use of std::stable_sort. The complexity of the algorithm is stated as 

O(N·log^2(N)), where N = std::distance(first, last) applications of cmp. If additional memory is available, then the complexity is O(N·log(N)). http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/stable_sort

In my application, memory is critical, therefore, I would prefer std::stable_sort to use the memory-optimised O(N·log^2(N))
algorithm, rather than the time-optimised O(N·log(N)) algorithm. 
I understand that the time-optimised version will only be chosen if it is safe
to do so (memory available). However, I aim to benchmark my application, and therefore, as memory is critical, want to benchmark the algorithm when memory consumption is lowest. As my system currently has enough memory to allocate
the buffer, it will automatically chose the O(N·log^2(N)) version of std::stable_sort. I would therefore like to assert to std::stable_sort to 
take the memory-optimised version. Is this possible?
The execution policy appears
to be a parameter that can modify the algorithm, however, it appears
to only alter the extent of parallelism.
http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/execution_policy_tag_t
Although choosing either
the parallel or sequential version may actually be choosing the O(N·log(N)) or

This answer demonstrates how to efficiently obtain an indices vector using std::sort on a vector of values using the nice new-ish C++11 functionality (there's also a variety of duplicates of that question as well). It also hints that you can obtain the double output of both the sorted vector and the sorted indices by ""using an extra vector."" However, the only way I can achieve this is by calling std:sort a second time. I'm working with arrays with lengths of tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands of elements trying to focus on efficiency. Is it possible to obtain both the sorted vector and the indices of the sort from a single call to std::sort?
More generally, my question is: can one sort multiple vectors with a single sort call? The assumption is the sorting order is based on only one of the supplied vectors.
What I've come up with in the meantime is below (a slight modification to the code in the linked answer). As you can see, it requires a call to std::sort for each vector being sorted, even though they are all to be ordered according to the sorting of a single vector. I suspect there may be a way to do this by passing references to the lambda compare function, but I can't seem to make it work.

I have a vector of custom objects I'm sorting and noticed that the sort took a bit longer than expected.  I decided to look further into it and adapted the code from this sort benchmark where instead of vector<double>, I'm sorting a vector<Foo>.  The result is that it takes about 2.5 times longer to sort the vector of custom objects, measured using boost::chrono::steady_clock as in the original benchmark code.  This doesn't really make sense to me since the key is the same and the memory is already allocated by the time sorting starts.  Why is that and does this affect other operations on such a vector, for example binary_search?

In std::sort you can supply a third argument which is the basis for how it sorts a list. If you want the first argument to come first, then you return true. If you want the second argument to come first you return false. I have come across the problem that my predicate function supposedly is an ""invalid comparator"", and I have narrowed it down to the fact that it does not fulfil the following requirement:
There have been some terms I have seen such as that std::sort requires ""strict weak ordering"". Apart from 2 places, all the other pages I get about these topics seem to be technical papers, and I can't understand it. What I can understand of it is that:
But to me this is also the meaning of a ""partially ordered set"", which is:
Furthermore, I can't understand what the ""strict"" implies in either of them.
Leaving aside my confusion about order theory terminology, my question is if in the compare function argument 1 and argument 2 are equal, and in which case I don't care which comes before the other (either one coming before would make me happy), why can't I return true to have argument 1 come first?
I was also going to ask how my program actually knows it's an invalid comparator but then I thought it probably just checks to see if arg1 and arg2 are equal when the compare function returns true.

45623856,Why std::sort construct objects?,"

This question already has an answer here:


std::sort does not always call std::swap

                    3 answers
                



I created the following class to understand the behavior of std::sort:
And run the following benchmark code:
The whole code in online IDE is here: https://wandbox.org/permlink/nbwRKptakgCSHK4f.
The measured number of calls of particular functions are as follows (all with -O2 or /O2 flags):
If I uncomment the swap function, situation gets better:
However, there still remains a lot of calls of the move constructor (plus destructor) and the move assignment operator. What bothers me is the efficiency. For instance, calls of swap and operator= can be inlined by the compiler, but I guess the compiler may not ""inline"" (optimize out) the construction/destruction of objects.
Why is construction/assignment of objects used in sorting? In-place sorting (which usually std::sort does) can be implemented purely by compare and swap operations.
UPDATE
My assumption was wrong. It seems perfectly legal to optimize out object creation/destruction, such as in:
Therefore, such code can be as efficient as custom swap. Online example: https://godbolt.org/g/ud4u9U - there  are no calls of move constructor / assignment operator, though these are not trivial, and their functionality is inlined into main.

This answer : What causes std::sort() to access address out of range explains why std::sort will address out-of-bounds when the comparison function doesn't respect irreflexibility (for example, quicksort where we do comp(pivot, pivot) and get true, thus the left pointer keeps walking right off the end of the array).
However, I am seeing crashes with comparisons that are irreflexive but non-transitive. I also believe I am going off the end of the array.
I cannot provide the exact code here as it is proprietary. The example above will not crash in my tests, but I am aware that std::sort will select different algorithms based upon the container and elements to be sorted.
What I'd like to know is if anybody knows why std::sort would crash under GNU C++ when the comparison is non-transitive? I know that non-transitive comparisons break the contract and it's undefined behaviour, but I was hoping for a similar answer to the one in the linked question - i.e. precisely why it can crash.

I find way 2 more appealing because my predicate is a bit more complicated than in the example, so I don't want to repeat it. But I wonder if partial_sort performs worse than sort because it is not meant to be used to sort the whole range, which is why I tend to use way 1.
Some testing yielded that partial_sort is significantly worse (factor of 4 in my usecase) than sort if if has to sort the whole range. This indicates that way 1 is to be preferred. It seems that partial_sort is only meant for sorting a small fraction of the whole range. I tested in Visual Studio 2010.

Here is my function for countingSort:
Note: I pass an array of 10 integers 2 0 3 2 5 4 3 6 10 to the function,the temporary array B, the maximum value (so I know what size to make C) and the size of array A

After the next for loop it C should be 2 1 2 2 1 1 1, which it also prints out correctly. Next it adds the elements of C up to get 2 3 5 7 8 9 10, which is also printed out correctly. Now my issue arises here when I try to put the elements of A into B. It is supposed to print 0 0 1 2 2 3 3 4 5 6, but it prints 0 0 0 1 0 2 3 3 4  5 instead.

I'm looking to parallelize bucket sort as an exercise. I am sorting integers lexiographically.
The motivation is, this is my first time doing any form of parallel programming. I'm trying to learn about the different ways of doing it, advantages/disadvantages.
E.g. {1,6,2,6778,8,2,43,52,23} -> [1 2 2 23 43 52 6 6778 8]
There are 3 steps to the task:
Initialize 9 vectors, 1 for each final bucket.
1) sort a chunk into buckets. This step parallelized by giving each thread a portion of the data.
2) sort each bucket into lexicographic order
3) concat all buckets
Visualization of the sort:

Option 1: Threadpool
I'm considering either dividing up all those tasks into jobs for 2 different functions, a bucketize function and a sort_bucket function then feeding them into a thread pool.
Option 2: Futures
Alternatively create futures of the functions and wait at the end of each step. Wait for all futures to return at the end of step 1, then create futures of sort_bucket in step 2 and join them.
Can anyone provide any opinions on these methods?

Intention: I have a vector of vectors named table. Each vector is of the same size. They consist of numbers ranging from 0-1000. 
What would be recommended the way of sorting the data structure named table in this case? Here, sorting refers to the table being sorted. Each element of the table is already sorted. The criterion for comparing vector v1 and vector v2 (lexicographical comparison). v1 is smaller than v2 if and only if the value at the first index l where v1[l] != v2[l], it holds the property v1[l] < v2[l].
Currently, I am using the following code snippet. I believe there would be a more efficient way from the fact the vectors are all sorted. Also, the size of each vector in the table is roughly around 4-10.

46703561,Implementing Lazy Sorting algorithm using C++,"
Our Professor gave us a programming exercise:

Juan Tamad is a lazy person. He is tasked to sort a list of numbers,
  but he is super lazy. He gets tired figuring out how to swap all the
  numbers around until all of them are in increasing order. So, he came
  up with his own algorithm that will guarantee that the new list is
  sorted. Here's how it works:
For a list of size n, we will need n-1 iterations. On each iteration,
Check if the nth number is smaller that the n+1 th number. If it is,
  then these two numbers are already sorted and we can skip this
  iteration If they are not, we continually decrement the first n
  numbers until these two numbers are in order.
For example, suppose the input is 
On the first iteration, we compare 10 and 5. 10 is larger than 5 so we
  decrement until its smaller:
Now we compare 5 and 7. 5 is smaller than 7, so we do not need to do
  anything and we skip this iteration. We go to the next and compare 7
  and 6. 7 is larger than 6, so we decrement the first three numbers
  until it's smaller than 6 and we get this:
Now we compare 6 and 1. Again, 6 is larger than 1, so we decrement the
  first four numbers until it's smaller than 1, and we get this:
And we're done. Now the list is in perfect sorted order.
Your assignment is to implement the sorting algorithm of Juan Tamad in
  a C++ program. Your program reads an input n and the list of n
  numbers. Your program them sorts the numbers using Juan Tamad's
  algorithm.

unknownPlayers.sort( PlayerObject::CountCmp() );
But for some reason the program is receiving SEGV. I used -fsanitize=address compilation flag to investigate and the stack-trace was like:
It seems to me the comparator is ok for strict-weak ordering. So what would be other possible cause to a segmentation fault in std::list::sort ?
EDIT 1:
I've tried to tranverse unknownPlayers using list::iterator and list::reverse_iterator just before sorting and it works fine. I could even access values through posCount() method and there wasn't anything odd with the returned values.
EDIT 2:
I've been trying to pick relevant code to post but I'm finding it a little troublesome.
I think some relevant facts about unknownPlayers would be:

It's filled by std::list::splice method:
unknownPlayers.splice(unknownPlayers.end(), new_unknown_players );

new_unknown_players is also filled by splice. Basically in every game cycle there's new information about seen players and these players may be identified as teammates, opponents or not identified at all(unknown players). There is a try to match not identified players with previously identified players(teammates or opponents) by a proximity threshold and if this fails, they're spliced into new_unknown_players linked list.

sort also does crash in the same way if I try to sort unknownPlayers before the call of splice in the line of code above
However, sort does not crash while unknownPlayers is empty (thank god it's not that messed up) and right after the first time the splice actually adds new objects and makes it not-empty for the first time.

Maybe this means in some other part of code something is corrupting the list? I can't still understand why tranversing is ok.

46511214,Maintaining a sorted list of numbers in multiset and the cumulative sums in another,"
I have an application in which integers are presented in no particular order. The integers presented can be repeat values. I have to maintain them in a sorted fashion. Each time a new entry is presented, it needs to be placed in the appropriate position so that the sorted order is maintained.
std::multiset seems to be one suggested solution with the best time, O(log n), for insertion.
Now, in addition to this sorted multiset, I have to maintain the cumulative sums in another container. 
That is, if the sorted entries are:
1, 5, 7, 9 (in indices 0, 1, 2 and 3)
the cumulative sum container would be:
1, 6, 13, 22 (in indices 0, 1, 2 and 3)
I am having trouble figuring out how to use the std::multiset iterator that is returned after each insert(int) operation into the multiset in order to update the cumulative sum container. Note that the cumulative sum will only affect in those entries and indices that have to be moved because of the insert operation.
That is, if to the above list, insert(8) has to be performed, the updated containers would be:
Sorted entries:
1, 5, 7, 8, 9 (in indices 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4)
Cumulative sum:
1, 6, 13, 21, 30 (in indices 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. Note that only entries in indices 3 and 4 are affected.)
At present, the only way I have been able to implement this is by using two arrays, one for the array of values and one for the cumulative sum. A working code that implements this is presented below:
As can be seen from this code, to calculate the cumulative sum, the integer array index, postoadd can be used until the end of the array is reached.
Is there any combination of containers that can perform better/more efficiently than the two integer arrays?
The return type of a std::multiset.insert(int) operation is an iterator that points to the inserted entry. Can this iterator be used to update another container that stores the cumulative sum?

but the answer produced is not a sorted array.(sorted partially)
After that, i guess it is caused by race condition on ""i++""
i tested i(printf i after/before swap), i is consecutive(wrong order, but doesnt matter?) that should means values from leftmost to pivot position have changed, no race condition.

The sort function does not work on my class objects.

They should be sorted based on the second name. But they are output in the same order that I enter them initially. 
I get no compile errors. I have tested the operator<() for my class and it works when comparing two objects of the class Person.

Say I have a class ClassToSort which I need to sort with std::sort() based on the values of val and secondVal (in ascending order of (val * 100) + secondVal).
Now, I have two ways to sort it, either precompute the value of (val * 100) + secondVal and store it in an std::unordered_map<int, long> valMap and refer to this map while sorting, or make function calls to getVal() and getSecondVal() each time while sorting (this will cause the number of function calls to double). Here are the two options:
and
It is clear that the second option will not only call getter functions for each object twice, but also do the same computation twice.

I do know that I should follow strict weak ordering for c++ comparator. And the main reason is that !(a > b) && !(b > a) should act as equivalence operator. 
But the problem is only sorting where you don't need equivalence operator not like std::set. 
For example, there is vector of sets and if set A is proper subset of B, then after sorting, index of set A should be smaller than index of set B. 
So assume that you write comparator like this
Then does std::sort with this comparator always work like topological sorting?

There are n_P players each holding n_H cards in their hand.
The deck and the hands share an array, like so:
Player i_P's hand contains all cards from from deck[i_P * n_H to deck[i_P * (n_H + 1) - 1]. All players combined always hold less than n_C cards.
Now I want to sort each player's hand, but not the entire deck (obviously, as this would move some cards between players' hands). I've gone about this like so:
And then, using insertion sort (this function will sort an entire array just fine):
*Note: card_swapdoes  exactly what you would expect it to, it's only 3 statements.
Both n_Cand n_H are #define'd constants, n_P is a local variable.

Here is the link for the program: http://gpe.acm-icpc.tw/domjudge2/pct/showproblemtab.php?probid=10527&cid=5. 
Here is the work I have done so far : 
First, I created a function that will sort the array which is ord(a, j) in the code below.
The variable j is the size of the array that will increment every time the user input a number.
To compute the median, I have two cases. 
1) if the size of the array is even, then I subtract the size of the array by 1 and divide it by 2, then the result will be the index of the sorted array plus the next element of the sorted array divided by 2 to find the median.
For example : an array of {1,3,6,2,7,8} elements. I will sort the array first which will give : {1,2,3,6,7,8} then the median will be (3+6)/2 = 4. 
2) if the size of the array is odd, then I subtract the size of the sorted array by 1 and divide it by 2, the result is the index of the median. 
For example : an array of {1,3,7,2,5} elements. I will sort the array first which will give : {1,2,3,5,7} then the median is 3.

I am currently trying to come up with a smart way to store my data, such that I can easily search, sort and insert.
My data consist of a std::pair<vector<int>,string> which is stored in a std::vector, forming sort of an 2d matrix.
Something like this: 

Each vector has a number sequence that matches a string. 
My problem here is when it should be tested. 
A test, consist of testing it with a test vector, which might be the same length or be smaller than those stored in the matrix. how do I find out which string the test vector best matches with?
How do i search for that efficiently?
Some thought of ideas on how to solve the problem, and some of the problems with them:

One idea was to make sub sums, depending on the length of the test vector, and then see which of the sub sums, best matches the sum of the test vector.

Problem: I am looking to the same pattern, so the same sum could occur given another pattern. 

Another idea was to make a copy of the matrix, sort it column wise, and make a search for a each index, and keep track of which the string were matching the best.. 

Problem:  This though requires sorting all the columns -  the matrix is way larger than showed above,  it has around 1000 columns, and it seems too expensive to make one search for a one sort -  given the amount of time I would spent on it - A insert possibility also need to be implemented, so something efficient would be appreciated.

48647589,Merging and sorting n strings in O(n),"
I recently was given a question in a coding challenge where I had to merge n strings of alphanumeric characters and then sort the new merged string while only allowing alphabetical characters in the sorted string. Now, this would be fairly straight forward except that the caveat added was that the algorithm had to be O(n) (it didn't specify whether this was time or space complexity or both). 
My initial approach was to concatenate the strings into a new one, only adding alphabetical characters and then sorting at the end. I wanted to come up with a more efficient solution but I was given less time than I was initially told. There isn't any sorting algorithm (that I know of) which runs in O(n) time, so the only thing I can think of is that I could increase the space complexity and use a sorted hashtable (e.g. C++ map) to store the counts of each character and then print the hashtable  in sorted order. But as this would require possibly printing n characters n times, I think it would still run in quadratic time. Also, I was using python which I don't think has a way to keep a dictionary sorted (maybe it does).
Is there anyway this problem could have been solved in O(n) time and/or space complexity?

48510380,Reuse result of string comparison for faster std::sort,"
I want to sort a vector of unique strings with strcmp.
std::sort expects a predicate telling whether one string is less than the other, however strcmp actually already returns the relationship of the strings and it would actually be wise to make use of that information instead of loosing it.
This is useful because it additionally needs to be determined whether strings are equal - in this case the predicate will get called again with the same strings but in inverse argument order.
This is the naive way of sorting:
I am experimenting with the following idea, where I store the result of the comparison and reuse it if the same strings get compared again.
In order to limit stored information and the number of additionally introduced comparisons, I thought of only storing the right string, which is becoming the left for the inverse comparison.
Now, my actual question is whether it is enough to check only the previously right string or do I need to store and check the previously left string as well?

OK, I typically default to assuming that the error is in my code, but what I am seeing is making literally no sense to me.

I have a std::vector<DocumentWidget *>, which I want to be sorted by some relatively simple algorithm. Here's what I am seeing.
The code looks like this:
Seems simple enough, but it crashes specifically when I have a 17th item in the list! The sorting predicate clearly is not modifying the vector in any way, so I can't see that being an issue. Address sanitizer and valgrind show no errors up until this point.
qSort does not crash, seems to work fine. No other threads that are running are touching this data, and it happens reliably no matter how slowly I step... so it's not a race condition.
When I look in the debugger, the a parameter seems to be where the ""one past the end"" iterator is pointing. But that shouldn't be happening if std::sort is behaving .
Note There are 17 items in the std::vector, I forced the debugger to display an 18th item to illustrate where a seems to be coming from.
I can't imagine that std::sort is bugged, but I am really struggling to find another explanation. Am I missing some obvious bug here?!

49581667,"Merging, sorting and removing duplicates a sorted vector and a unsorted vector","
Description of the process
A relatively slow part in my code consists of merging two vectors, v1 and v2. v1 is typically 2 to 1000 times longer than v2. v1 is sorted and does not contain any duplicate while v2 is not sorted and may contain duplicates.
The process consists at making v1 equals to the merge, sorted result of v1 and v2 to which we removed all duplicates. v2 shall be cleared from all contents For example, given the input
the process must output
The elements of v1 and v2 are not primitive data though and therefore the move semantics might come handy to increase performance.
Question
What is the fastest way to perform this process?

Let's first define the class. Note that the sorting / removing of duplicates shall only be done based on the attribute a as it is made clear from the definitions of the operators method of this class.

Say I have a std::unordered_map<std::string, int> that represents a word and the number of times that word appeared in a book, and I want to be able to sort it by the value.
The problem is, I want the sorting to be stable, so that in case two items have equal value I want the one who got inserted first to the map to be first. 
It is simple to implement it by adding addition field that will keep the time it got inserted. Then, create a comperator that uses both time and the value. Using simple std::sort will give me O(Nlog(N)) time complexity.
In my case, space is not an issue whenever time can be improved. I want to take advantage of it and do a bucket sorting. Which should give me O(N) time complexity. But when using bucket sorting, there is no comperator, when iterating the items in the map the order is not preserved.
How can I both make it stable and still keep the O(N) time complexity via bucket sorting or something else?
I guess that if I had some kind of hash map that preserves the order of insertion while iterating it, it would solve my issue.  
Any other solutions with the same time complexity are acceptable.

48764471,Sorting one vector with respect to another - most efficient way?,"
I'm aware that this question has already been asked a few times, but different answers have been provided for simple cases (where compactness, readability or user proficiency are the deciding factors) and I'm not sure which one is the most efficient, as I'm concerned with repeating that operation O(1M) times.
The setup is the following:

Two vectors A and B of float's; this cannot be changed, but additional structures can be created from A and B.
A and B have equal length, which is at least 4 and at most 20 (if that's helpful in any way).
A needs to be sorted in descending order based on the values of its entries, while B simply needs to match A's ordering.

Example:
Question:

What's the most efficient (= fast + memory saving) way of doing this?

The max-heap function is working fine but heapsort is not working.
When I run this code. it shows incorrect calculation.
As you can see my last output, the Ascending numerical order is the same value as max-heap but this is not what I am expecting.
My task is that I have to sort a number from the max-heap. Also, I have to swap first and last element from the max-heap array and then ignore the last element. Also, once the last element is ignored I have to do max-heap function again.
An example of how the calculation works. max-heap is: 86, 79, 42, 75, 33, 9. In the sorting section, I have to swap first and last element and then ignore the last element, so the heap sort result should be: 9, 79, 42, 75, 33, [86] (square bracket mean ignored or removed). I have to do max-heap again from the previous sorting. The second max-heap result would be 79, 75, 9, 42, 33. when I come back to the sorting I have to swap the first and last element and then ignore the last element again so the max-heap is 79, 75, 9, 42, 33 and the heap sort result should be: 33, 75, 9, 42, [79], [86]. I have to do the same step all over again until all the number sorted.
An example of output that I want to display on:     
My input is 9, 79, 42, 86, 33, 75
Max- heap should be: 86, 79, 42, 75, 33, 9.

I see the very large performance difference when sorting std::string objects compared to pairs of pointer+length and std::string works much faster
I am doing a lot of sorting in my application and I have found that the performance bottleneck is at sorting the large arrays of strings. I know two good ways to do such sorting - use std::sort and Boost.sort functions. I am sorting the parts of large file by using pointers and string length information
I have tried to compare my performance with sorting the std::string objects and my simple pointer+length structures are much slower. I can't imagine - why?
The sizeof(std::string) is 32, while sizeof(my_struct) is 16 bytes. Both of them are using ::memcmp function internally to compare
To describe the problem I have made a small application that can show the performance difference between soring std::string and my structure objects:
Here is same code at IDE One
And the program output is
The problem remains if I will use std::sort instead of Boost.Sort. 
BUT if I will try to change the LEN parameter to 16 and larger, my structures starts sorting with the same speed. 
So my question - how can I improve my code to keep it sorting as fast as std::string objects when using small strings?

49717410,Is it possible to pass an iterator from a vector of pointers by reference to another function?,"
I am working on a basic programme which is designed to dynamically model a road network. The project so far uses a vector of type parent vehicle pointers to store vehicle child objects (cars, vans, lorries etc).
The aim of the project is to calculate and sum the distance travelled by each vehicle child object stored in the parent vector and then reorder the vector based on the distance furthest travelled to distance least travelled.
I am using a sorting algorithm which compares the data member total_dist which stores the summed distance travelled by each object.
Due to an earlier issue, I had to explicitly initialize the total_dist data member to 0 for each object within the vector.
Because of this, the sorting algorithm only ""sees"" the initialised value (i.e. 0) which means that the vector is not being rearranged.
The natural solution to this (at least in the mind of a novice programmer like myself) is to alter the the function which calculates total_dist to accept a pass by reference in order to update the data member as the programme runs. 
However, I'm not actually sure if this is syntactically possible. This is what I currently have (I know my code is probably really ugly and inelegant but I'm still very new to programming in general).
Method
I know setting data members to public is undesirable but It's the only way I get get my algorithm to work within my current abilities.
Vector Initialisation
If total_dist isn't explicitly initialised, the initial summed value isn't defined therefore set_total_dist() calculates what i believe is to be some sort of alphanumeric error value.
Vector Iterator and Sorting Algorithm
The compiler doesn't like when I'm passing (*it)->get_grid_location() by reference but compiles just fine when I'm passing the argument by value. When trying to pass be reference, the IDE shows a red underline between the double left-hand parentheses ((.
The error i get before compilation, when trying to pass by reference is:

initial value of reference to non-const must be an lvalue

After compilation, I get:

Error C2664   'void Vehicle::set_total_dist(float &)': cannot convert
  argument 1 from 'float' to 'float &'

I have tried searching for posts identical to mine but I haven't had any luck, the issues I found which were somewhat related to mine such as What's wrong with passing C++ iterator by reference?

49693970,two way merge sort for 2 file c++,"
I was asked to apply Two way merge sort on two files(files of records) ,
the algorithm explains the steps as follows : 

Sort phase 
  1)The records on the file to be sorted are divided into several groups. 
  Each group is called a run, and each run  fits into main memory.
  2)An internal sort is applied to each run, 3)and the resulting sorted runs are distributed to two external files.
Merge Sort: 1) One run from each of the external files created in the sort phase merge into a larger runs of sorted records.
  2)The result is stored in a third file.
  3)The data is distributed back into the first two files, and merging continues until all records are in one large run.

I was able to apply Sort Phase only , so the current files is :
(supposed run contains 3 keys only )

file 1:
  50 95 110 | 40 120 153 | 22 80 140
file 2: 
  10 36 100 | 60 70 130 

here's the steps of merge phase
so if i will solve it theoretically will perform the following : 
Merge Phase:
step1 :
file 3 :
 10 36 50 95 100 110 | 40 60 70 120 130 153 | 22 80 140
file 1: 
10 36 50 95 100 100 | 22 80 140
file 2 : 
40 60 70 120 130 153
step 2 : 
file 3 :
10 36 40 50 60 70 95 100 110 120 130 135 | 22 80 140
file 1 : 
10 36 40 50 60 70 95 100 110 120 130 135

Maybe they want to help us, considering that arrays start at 0. So we might think that if we want to sort the first n elements, we go all the way to v[n] but in reality we only go to v[n-1].  So that would explain the fact that the function sorts up to last - 1. But in this case why doesn't it start at first - 1? At the begging we put 1 and we start from v[1] but then we put n and stop at v[n-1]. Why? If it would consider arrays indeed from one, it should include the last element. These are just my - probably stupid - thoughts? This is why I would appreciate a true explanation. Thanks!
Edit: Thank you all so much for your answers. I can see there are many advantages and everything looks more normal in this range. I will try to remember all your examples to make it clear in my mind.

51251035,How to sort integer numbers in a huge text file?,"
Problem Statement
I'm given a very large list of numbers one at a time, and I need to print the ""median number"".
To be more clear there can be ""125,000,000"" numbers and it is guaranteed that each number is less than ""1.e+18"".
It's for a contest, so there is memory limit (20 MB tops) and time limit (5 seconds tops).
""The median number"" is the one that is in the middle of sorted numbers.
For instance if this is the list of numbers:
After sorting numbers:
""The median number"" would be 16;
So I searched for it in the Internet but I couldn't find any answer that pass these limits.


Approach
My approach was to get all the numbers, save them in a text file, sort them, then get ""the median number"".

Ideas

I know I can read all the numbers from the file and put them in a vector
then easily sort them.But this will exceed memory limit.
So I came up with this idea to sort numbers as I put them in text
file.It would be like there is a loop that after getting next
number from the console reads the file (line by line) and when it
reaches right place, inserts number there and doesn't touch other
numbers.But the problem is that I can't insert a line in the middle of
text file because it will overwrite on other numbers.
So I created two files that one of them had numbers that were already
inputted and the other one read the first file and copy it's number in
itself until reach right place then insert last given number then
continue copying remaining numbers.But it spends too much time so it
exceeded time limit.



Request
So I want to either optimize one of these ideas in order to pass limits or any new idea that pass these limits.


Preference
I prefer to use second idea because unlike other two, it passes limits but I can't do it because I don't know how to insert a line in the middle of a text file. So if I learn this, rest of the process will be so easy.


Attempted Solution
This is a function that receives a number and, by reading through a file, finds best place for it and puts it there.
As the matter of fact it represents my third idea.
So it works (I tested it with lots of inputs) but the problem as I mentioned before is with the time limit.

the 2 vectors have not the same size. One vector (keys) is size X and the other (descriptors) is size X*128 (one key is parametrized by 128 values).

then I use the sort function to sort these index depending scale of a key (keys[i].s).
After that, I generate another vector in which I copy the values using the vector of index for both descriptors and keys (calling them descriptors_tmp, and keys_tmp), and then I want to make the first keys vector equal to the keys_tmp, and the same for descriptors equals to descriptors_tmp.
My question are : 
-Is there a way to make that without making any copy. Since I don't need the previous version of  keys and descriptors, I could just make the vector point on the other vector (something like *keys = *keys_tmp) ?

I have a 2D array a[][40]. I'm trying to sort it by calling std::sort, and I have written the Compare function. However, C++ wants me to have a std::vector to be sorted, not a simple array and I want the sorted array to be a itself, I don't want to create another array and save the sorting result there. It seems there are a lot of ways to achieve that. I could think of five ways, but none of them seems to be efficient and working.
1)

Directly use std::sort(std::begin(a), std::begin(a) + something, cmp);

It doesn't work, because std::begin doesn't know how to point to the beginning of a 2D array. Furthermore, it'd sort incorrectly even if it compiled, since a 2D array is not an array of references to arrays, but consecutive arrays (unlike Java)
Playground: https://godbolt.org/g/1tu3TF
2)

Then copy everything back to a

It doesn't work, because it's a 2D array, and it can't be sorted this way, using std::sort. In contrast to the first trial, this one uses twice as much as memory, and copies everything twice (if it worked)!
Playground: https://godbolt.org/g/TgCT6Z
3)

Then change the order of a to be the same of k; 
  The idea is simple, create a vector of representative ""pointers"", sort them (as the cmp2 function secretly accesses a and compares the values), then make a have the same order with k.

In the end, the re-ordering loop will be very complex, will require a large, temporary variable. Besides, for cmp2 to access the values of a, a global variable-pointer that points to a must be created, which is ""bad"" code.
Playground: https://godbolt.org/g/EjdMo7
4)

For all unsigned char[40], a struct can be created and their values can be copied to structs. Comparison and = operators will need to be declared. After sorted, they can be copied back to a.

It'd be a great solution if the arrays didn't have to be copied to structs to use struct's operators, but they need to be copied, so all values will be copied twice, and twice-as-needed memory will be used.
5)

For all unsigned char[40], a struct that has a pointer to them can be created. They can be sorted by the pointed values, and the result can be saved to a pointer array.

It's probably the best option, although the result is a pointer array instead a. Another reason on why it's good is it doesn't move the arrays, but the pointers.
To sum up, I need to sort the 2D array a[][40] via std::sort, but I haven't decided on the best way. It seems there's a ""best way to do that"" which I can't think of. Could you please help me?

Hey i got this algorithm from my class called Bubble Sort. It uses two ""for"" one inside the other. But when i tried to do it with ""while"" it didnt work, aren't they equivalent ?
I commented the one that worked next to the other so i could compare, i thought it was the same but with while instead of for

Array = {10, 2, 8, 11, 5, 3, 27, 1}

Is there a Way by which i can get this done . One way possible is to maintain vector array such that I have first 1 number sorted then first 2 numbers sorted then first 3 numbers sorted and so on but it will take 1log1 + 2log2 + 3log3 + .... + nlogn time which is N^2logN complexity.

I have an array of pairs that represent a range of [begin,end).  The array can be assumed to already sorted by the 'begin' field.
I want to generate a new array with all of the overlaps removed, and additional pairs created, as needed.
For example, let's say the array contained the following pairs:
The output should be as follows:
Ultimately, the output array should contain no overlaps at all.
What's the most optimal solution that takes no more than O(m), where m is the number of entries needed in the output array?  I think I see a way to do it in O(n^2), where n is the number of entries in the input array, but there's got to be a better way.
The final implementation will be in C++11, using vectors of pairs of doubles, although pseudocode solutions are fine.

I appreciate all responses, but I would politely request in advance to please not post any solutions that depend on particular frameworks or libraries unless such frameworks are part of standard c++11.

3757270,Most Efficient way to 'look up' Keywords,"
Alright so I am writing a function as part of a lexical analyzer that 'looks up' or searches for a match with a keyword. My lexer catches all the obvious tokens such as single and multi character operators (+ - * / > < = == etc) (also comments and whitespace are already taken out) so I call a function after I've collected a stream of only alphanumeric characters (including underscores) into a string, this string then needs to be matched as either a known keyword or an identifier.
So I was wondering how I might go about identifying it? I know I basically need to compare it to some list or array or something of all the built in keywords, and if it matches one return that match to it's corresponding enum value; otherwise, if there is no match, then it must be a function or variable identifier. So how should I look for matches?

I need to find within image A a pixel which (with its' neighbors) most closely resembles image B, OR the pixel that probably most closely resembles image B.
Resemblance is calculated as ""distance"" which is sum of ""distances"" between non-transparent B's pixels and A's pixels divided by number of non-transparent B's pixels. Here is a sample SDL code for explanation:
This thing is supposed to be used for texture generation.
Now, the question:
The easiest way to do this is brute force search (which is used in example routine). But it is slow - even using GPU acceleration and dual core cpu won't make it much faster. It looks like I can't use modified binary search because of B's mask. So, how can I find desired pixel faster? 
Additional Info:  

It is allowed to use 2 cores, GPU acceleration, CUDA, and 1.5..2 gigabytes of RAM for the task.  
I would prefer to avoid some kind of lengthy preprocessing phase that will take 30 minutes to finish.

Recently, our big project began crashing on unhandled division by zero. No recent code seems to contain any likely elements so it may be new data sets affecting old code. The problem is the code base is pretty big, and running on an embedded device with no comfortable debug access (debug is done by a lot of printf()s over serial console, there is no gdb for the device and even if there was, the binary compiled with debug symbols wouldn't fit).
The most viable way would likely be to find all the division operations (they are relatively infrequent), and analyze code surrounding each of them to see if any of the divisor variables was left unguarded. 
The question is then either how to find all division operations in a big (~200 files, some big) C++ project, or, if you have a better idea how to locate the error, please give them.

I just want to know whether the needle exists in the haystack. Location of the needle isn't relevant to me.
Background:
I have a repository containing a lot of email bodies. The messages are in different languages (japanese, german, russian, finnish; you name it). All the data is in Unicode format, and I load it to wide strings (wchar_t) in my C++ application (the bodies have been MIME decoded, so in my debugger I can see the actual japanese, german characters). I don't know the language of the messages since email messages doensn't contain that detail, also a single email body may contain characters from several languages.

Then I want to be able to get the directory names in the current directory.
In C#, it is a breeze to implement this functionality, but I am using C++. I tried using the windows API for this, but you know how the WIN API can be a pain in the neck and takes a million lines of code just to get a simple thing done. :P
So what are some good libs for this?
Thanks

Thanks and kudos to Charles Bailey for a perfect answer to my question. Thanks to others for their efforts too.

But I can imagine several scenarios where this situation could occur.

This gave me a ""too many initializers"" error.

758041,"How can I recursively search a list of lists for an item, getting the ""closest"" match","
This may take a little explaining, so please bare with me.
I have a class ""Class"" which has a member std::list, I want to search that list/tree for an item, specifically an item with a specific name.
A basic representation of my class is as follows.


#include <list>
#include <string>
class Class {
    std::string _name;
    std::list<Class*> _members;
public:
    Class(const std::string& name) : _name(name) {}
    void addMember(Class* member) { _members.push_back(member); }
    const std::string& name() const { return _name; }
    const std::list members() const { return _members; }
    Class* findItem(const std::string& name) const { ... }
};


I could just do something like this in Class::findItem:


Class* Class::findItem(const std::string& n) const {
    std::list<Class>::const_iteratior i;
    for(i=_members.begin(); i!=_members.end(); ++i)
        if((*i)->name() == n) return *i;

      Class* cls = (*i)->findItem(n);
      if(cls) return cls;
    }
    return 0;
}


But, what I want to happen is for findItem() to return the ""closest"" item to the one searched from.
For instance, if this is my tree, with each letter representing one level in the list hierarchy, and each number representing the items ""value"". I want findItem(3) to return B(3), rather than C(3).

7208535,Binary Tree search returns no results (C++),"
I am working on some binary tree algorithms and need a ""find node with searchindex..."" function. The design for treenodes is basically
and a tree is defined by a pointer to the root-node.
My implementation for the search function is:
Arguments: *root is the root-node of the tree, nodeIndex is the search-index and *resultNode is the pointer to the found (or not) node in the tree.
The function does not return a reference or pointer to the found node but modifies the pointer resultNode so it points to the found node. The idea is to initialize resultNode with NULL, perform the search and modify it if a match occurs. Otherwise it remains NULL and I can easily check if there are search results or not.
Another class with a tree buildingTree as member utilizes the search-function in this way:
I create *resultNodePtr on the stack because I just need it temporarily inside the function. Is this done correctly? However: The function does not work. resultNodePtr is always NULL, even if the tree contains a node with the search-index. I debugged it very carefully step by step, it detects  
correctly but
does not work (I want resultNode to point to the same adress root points to).
Debugger says resultNode before assignment is 0x0, root node is some adress, after the assignment resultNode remains 0x0. 
Do I have to overload the operator= in this case for the class TreeNode?
I have tried it:
I am not an expert but this operator= seems trivial. Does it affect the assignment of two TreeNode pointers *node1 = *node2 at all?
Maybe you can help me. Thanks for reading, appreciate your help.
If I find a solution myself I will post it here.

For example, the first 4 bytes say there are 5 names stored into the array, and the next 4 bytes tell you the address of the person's name. The person's name is stored in the array
so num would tell you theres 5 names in the array and ppl1 would tell you the position of the array where you can find the first name and name collects the name of the person located at that slot of the array.

6919405,Mystical restriction on std::binary_search,"
Problem description:
Consider some structure having an std::string name member. For clearness let's suppose that it's a struct Human, representing information about people. Besides the name it can also have many other data members.
Let there be a container std::vector<Human> vec, where the objects are already sorted by name. Also for clearness suppose that all the names are unique.
The problem is: having some string nameToFind find out if there exists an element in the array having such name.
Solution and my progress:
The obvious and natural solution seems to perform a binary search using the std::binary_search function. But there is a problem: the type of the element being searched (std::string) is different from the type of the elements in the container (Human), and std::binary_search needs a rule to compare these elements. I tried to solve this in three ways, described below. First two are provided just to illustrate the evolution of my solution and the problems which I came across. My main question refers to the third one.
Attempt 1: convert std::string to Human.
Write a comparing function:
Then add a constructor which constructs a Human object from std::string:
and use the binary_search in following form:
Seems working, but turns up two big problems:
First, how to initialize other data members but Human::name, especially in the case when they don't have a default constructor ? setting magic values may lead to creation of an object which is semantically illegal.
Second, we have to declare this constructor as non explicit to allow implicit conversions during the algorithm. The bad consequences of this are well known.
Also, such a temporary Human object will be constructed at each iteration, which can turn out to be quite expensive.
Attempt 2: convert Human to std::string.
We can try to add an operator string () to the Human class which returns it's name, and then use the comparsion for two std::strings. However, this approach is also inconvenient by the following reasons:
First, the code will not compile at once because of the problem discussed here. We will have to work a bit more to make the compiler use the appropriate operator <.
Second, what does mean ""convert a Human to string"" ? Existence of such conversion can lead to semantically wrong usage of class Human, which is undesirable.
Attempt 3: compare without conversions.
The best solution I got so far is to create a
and use binary search as
This compiles and executes correctly, everything seems to be ok, but here is where the interesting part begins:

I have a structure that I need to put into a container in C++.  here is the struct:
I will need about 65 of these structs, so I'm looking to put them into a container (I'm thinking a list, a vector, or a map).  I need to be able to access the function pointer (process) of a given PDCUTestMessage via two different search values: name and id.  I noticed that map only allows one value and one key.  Is there any container that would allow me to quickly search for a PDCUTestMessage use either name or id as a key?  And how would I write the search and access the function that the pointer is pointing to?
I hope this makes sense.  Let me know if you need further clarification.

5681129,How to extend Windows Desktop Search a la Outlook,"
I would like to extend windows desktop search to include results from my custom data store (like how Outlook does it).  Meaning, when someone does a search in the Start Menu on Vista or Windows 7, I would like my results to show up in ""My Custom Category"" where each result is an individual entry in my custom data store.
I've done a lot of reading through the MSDN docs and it feels like they're incomplete.  I've also played with a number of the samples in both the Windows 7 SDK and the Windows Search 3x SDK.  I was hoping that the RegSearch sample in the Windows Search SDK (which is a sample Protocol Handler implementation) would be useful, however, it doesn't seem to work.  I can build it and get it registered, but the search service returns the following errors (from Event Viewer): 
(Note: I removed the SID when posting, but the logs contained it)
Followed by:
And then:
And finally, the first error is repeated.
Has anyone gotten this sample working?  Is the protocol handler approach the right approach for what I'm trying to accomplish?
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

5480974,Is it possible to extend the Windows Search index with just a Filter handler?,"
I want to try and extend the Windows Search index with some custom data I have.  To do this, I have put the data in a custom file format, and wrote a Windows Search filter handler that knows how to register a new file type with the indexer.  It appears as though my code should work: when I register the DLL, the new filetype shows up in the list of indexable ""File Types"" in the Indexing options, and when I run filtdump.exe against my custom file type, it correctly outputs the values I want output for each chunk.
That being said, I can't get the values to show up in the Windows Search index.  I've tried re-indexing (multiple times), I've tried changing the advanced Index options to ""Index properties and file contents"".  I'm putting my custom files in indexed locations, like the Documents folder and the Desktop.
At a high-level: is it really possible to extend the Windows search index with just a filter handler that works with a custom file format?  It says in the docs that you must implement a shell data source with a protocol handler to extend the index, but then says in other places that if you're just adding a new custom file format, you just have to create a filter handler (or a protocol handler).  I'm not sure what's correct.  I don't really need a shell data source for what I'm trying to accomplish.
If there are any testing ideas that people have out there, those would be appreciated too.  Thanks!

5412318,What is the fastest way to check if any files in a directory tree have changed?,"
Currently I'm checking against an XOR Checksum of the modified file time (st_mtime from fstat) for every file in the tree. I'm coupling this with the number of files found and a file size checksum (allowing overflows) to be safe but I'm quite paranoid that this can and will lead to false positives in the most extreme pathological cases.
One alternative (safe) option I am considering is keeping a manifest of every file by name and a CRC32 of the file contents. This option however is pretty slow, or slower than I would like at least for many files (lets say thousands).
So the question is, what are some tips or tricks you may have for determining whether any file has changed within a directory tree? I'd like to avoid a byte-by-byte comparison without trading away too much reliability. 
Thanks very much for your suggestions.

Records can be only sequentially looked up within a block from the start of the block.

5047299,Finding pattern in large binary file using C or C++?,"
I have a ~700 MB binary file (non-text data); what I would like to do is search for a specific pattern of bytes that occurs in random locations throughout the file.  e.g. 0x? 0x? 0x55 0x? 0x? 0x55 0x? 0x? 0x55 0x? 0x? 0x55 and so on for 50 or so bytes in sequence.  The pattern I'd be searching for would be a sequence two random bytes with 0x55 occurring every two bytes.
That is, search for tables stored in the file with 0x55 being the delimiter, and then save the data contained in the tables or otherwise manipulate it.
Would the best option be simply going through every individual byte one at a time, and then looking ahead two bytes to see if the value is 0x55, and if it is, then looking ahead again and again to confirm that a table exists in that location?
Load the whole thing? fseek?  Buffer chunks, searching those one byte at a time?
What would be the best way of looking through this large file, and finding the pattern, using C or C++?

4827503,Quick 64bit integer ID Lookup/Search,"
I'm working on a game, and to be on the safe side any user (programmer) is only allowed to store IDs to objects instead of pointers, and must use this ID to get the pointer to the object in order to have to some quality alone-time with it.
Let's use the worst case scenario: Every single ID is in use. It is 64 bit so there ya go: 18446744073709551616 IDs to search through. A lot of the data is stored in a database, and our program lookup either returns a pointer, or a null pointer. A null pointer means the program must access the database in order to load the object, after which it will have a pointer.
Ideas:
So the only real trick I know here is binary search. So in the worst case that means 64 comparisons for every ID lookup.
Another idea I had was creating a static space partition, a tree where every branch splits up into a power of 2 amount of branches, but only until a reasonable depth. Using a bitwise operator on the ID instead of the modulus operator to find out what branch it belongs to on every level. Every possible branch in the tree always exists, but at some depth they stop and a binary search is still required because the exact number of values is still unknown.
What are your ideas?

I've been tasked with making a program that searches 400+ movies (linked together using a linked list) by title, genre, year, rating, lead actor, etc.
There is a catch though, we are only allowed ONE search function to preform the searches through the linked list. Also, within that search function, we are only allowed one while loop—which I assume in my case will be something like...
Obviously their will be many different instances if its an actor search, or a genre search. In the case of actor, genre, rating, year, sub-genre, and supporting actor, it should output every single instance of it was found. (for example, if Kevin Bacon was in x-men and the notebook, it should output both not just one of them (to the output file not the screen)).
I've found myself completely stumped by these restrictions that we were given.
How will my search function handle different data types? (year and rating have to be declared as integers). How will it know what exactly I'm searching for? If I'm searching for actor, I don't want it to search for title as well.
Any suggestions on how to get started and get going are very appreciated.

I am writing a program for numerical simulation by using std::map to store some key-value pairs. The map is used as storing the states evoluted during the simulation. The type of the key is a integer and the value of corresponds to the key tells how many copies are there for the same keys, i.e. std::map. For each step of the simulation, I need to calculate how many values are there for the same key, so I will check that by the following code
However, I soon find that this code doesn't work because even there is no such key in the map, whenever you call the map[key], it will generate a placeholder for that key and set the value as zero; therefore, I always overcount the total number of keys by std::map.size(). I later change the code as follow to search the key instead
So is it the only and fastest way to check if a key exists or not for a map? I am going to run the simulation for hundreds millions times and it will call above code very often to check the key. Will it be too slow to use map.find() instead? Thanks.

8910000,How to approximate the count of distinct values in an array in a single pass throught it,"
I have several huge arrays (millions++ members). All those are arrays of numbers and they are not sorted (and I cannot do that). Some are uint8_t, some uint16_t/32/64. I would like to approximate the count of distinct values in these arrays. The conditions are following:

speed is VERY important, I need to do this in one pass through the array and I must go through it sequentially (cannot jump back and forth) (I am doing this in C++, if that's important)
I don't need EXACT counts. What I want to know is that if it is an uint32_t array if there are like 10 or 20 distinct numbers or if there are thousands or millions.
I have quite a bit of memory that I can use, but the less is used the better
the smaller the array data type, the more accurate I need to be 
I dont mind STL, but if I can do it without it that would be great (no BOOST though, sorry) 
if the approach can be easily parallelized, that would be cool (but its not a mandatory condition)

Examples of perfect output:
I understand that some of the constraints may seem illogical, but thats the way it is.
As a side note, I also want the top X (3 or 10) most used and least used values, but that is far easier to do and I can do it on my own. However if someone has thoughts for that too, feel free to share them!
EDIT: a bit of clarification regarding STL. If you have a solution using it, please post it. Not using STL would be just a bonus for us, we dont fancy it too much. However if it is a good solution, it will be used!

8903737,STL Map with a Vector for the Key,"
I'm working with some binary data that I have stored in arbitrarily long arrays of unsigned ints.  I've found that I have some duplication of data, and am looking to  ignore duplicates in the short term and remove whatever bug is causing them in the long term.
I'm looking at inserting each dataset into a map before storing it, but only if it was not found in the map to start with.  My initial thought was to have a map of strings and use memcpy as a hammer to force the ints into a character array, and then copy that into a string and store the string.  This failed because a good deal of my data contains multiple bytes of 0 (aka NULL) at the front of the relevant data, so a majority of very real data got thrown out.
My next attempt is planned to be std::map<std::vector<unsigned char>,int>, but I'm realizing that I don't know if the map insert function will work.
Is this doable, even if ill advised, or is there a better way to approach this problem?
Edit
So it's been remarked that I didn't make clear what I'm doing, so here's a hopefully better description.
I'm working on generating a minimum spanning tree, given that I have a number of trees containing the actual end nodes I'm working with.  The goal is to come up with the selection of trees that has the shortest length and that covers all of the end nodes, where the chosen trees share at most one node with each other and are all connected.  I'm basing my approach off of a binary decision tree, but making a few changes to hopefully allow for greater parallelism.
Rather than taking the binary tree approach I've opted to make a bit vector out of unsigned integers for each dataset, where a 1 in a bit position indicates the inclusion of the corresponding tree.
For example if just tree 0 were included in a 5 tree dataset I would start with
00001
From here I can generate:
00011
00101
01001
10001
Each of these can then be processed in parallel, since none of them depend on each other.  I do this for all of the single trees (00010, 00100, etc..) and should, I haven't taken the time to formally prove it, be able to generate all values in the range (0,2^n) once and only once.
I started to notice that many datasets were taking far longer to complete than I thought they should, and enabled a debugging output to look at all of the generated results, and a quick Perl script later it was confirmed that I had multiple processes generating the same output.  Since then I've been trying to resolve where the duplicates are coming from with very little success, and I'm hoping that this will work well enough to let me verify the results that are being generated without the, sometimes, 3 day wait on computations.

8746263,Better std::find on a collection of pointers and comparing dereferenced value to a const reference value,"

The design changed and std::vector<Point> became std::vector<Point*> and the previous method no longer worked and I had to change it to:
Does std::find perform the same linear search? If so, is there a faster/better/less gross way to do this (especially the double de-reference of the iterator)?
There are other places in the code that the std::find(this->_result_points.begin(), _result_points.end(), point) != _result_points.end(); (or similar, but opposite results) is performed and I would rather not have to use that slow linear for loop.

Or, scan and set up a new bool array B to mark whether a number in the given array appears or not, e.g. B[A[i]] = true or false. Then, scan the bool array to the false element whose index is the missing element. Time O(n) but space O(n).  
Are there solutions of O(n) in time and O(1) in space ?

Suppose missing numbers are  x and y. 
we cannot get:
x + y = sum of 1 to n - sum of A

If a and c can be merged, then store the result in ret and return true; otherwise, return false. The merge operation is reflective and transitive.
A solution is found if either:

∃ x0, x1, ..., xN-1. merge(VA[0][x0], VA[1][x1], merge(VA[2][x2], ..., merge(VA[N-2][xN-2],VA[N-1][xN-1], ret)...));
any elements from N-1 (not N) sub-vectors can be merged (pick any N-1 with exactly one exception).

For example:
VA is of size 3. Element a can be merged with Element b with the result c. Element c can be merged with Element d with the result e.

VA[0] = {a}
VA[1] = {b, q}
VA[2] = {d, r}

All solutions in the above example are: {a,b}, {a,d}, {b,d}, {a,b,d}.

Here's how I'm going to use the structure:
Let say that I have an array(let's call it queryArr) of objects (~ 10,000 objects) each objects have 3 parameter (x,y,z) I have another very large array(let's call it totalArr) of objects ( > 5,000,000 objects).
What I'm trying to do here is given element of queryArr, find the most similar(or the same element in totalArr) In some cases there will be an object with the same parameters in totalArr, but in most cases, there won't be an object with same parameters. 
So, I'll search all the values in between (x+10,y+10,z+10) and (x-10,y-10,z-10). If it doesn't yield any result, I'll multiply x,y,z by 2 and try again until it yields some results. 
The simplest way of doing this is a naive search method, which will have complexity of  O(N*M) (N = size of queryArr, M = sie of totalArr) but this method is incredibly slow and dumb.
I think Range Tree's is the way to go, but I have never implemented one myself and I don't quite understand how the range tree works on dimensions bigger than 2. So does anyone know a good implementation of the range trees? I believe if I can have a source code, I'll be able to understand how they really work.
By the way if you think, there is a better structure than Range Tree for this task, let me know I'm open to suggestions. (I have already considered kd-Trees and Interval trees)

13227154,finding a element in a matrix with the minimum cost starting from one point,"
I have n*n matrix and I want to find the element from the matrix that has the minimum cost, the cost of a node meaning cost = Manhattandistance(startingnode,node) + costof(node) where starting node is a node in which perspective I am searching! 
I did it just with 4 for loops and it works but I want to optimize it and I did something like a bfs: I used a queue and added first the starting node, after that in a while loop I pop ed the node from the queue and added to the queue all the elements around that node with the Manhatttan 1. I do this while the distance of the node that I just popped from the queue + the minimum price from the whole matrix (which I know from the start) is less than the minimum price that I have just found ( I compare the price of the node I just popped with min) if it's bigger I stop searching because the minimum node I found is the lowest possible value. The problem is this algorithm is to slow possibly because I use a std::queue? and it works in more time than the 4 for loops version. (I also used a flags matrix to see if the element I am inspecting when I add to the queue has been already added). The most time consuming block of code is the part I expand the node don't know why I just inspect if the element is valid I mean it's coordinates are less than n and bigger than 0 if ok I add the element to the queue! 
I want to know how can I improve this or if it's another way to do it! Hope I was explicit enough. 
this is the part of code that takes to long:

13223604,Pair of vectors instead of a vector<pair>?,"
I'm looking for a lib that would implement something similar to std::map and multimap, but without tree but vectors instead, like a pair<vector<key>,vector<value>>. The lib would have to keep the vectors synchronized and sorted.
I'd like to compare the performance of maps, vector<pair<key,value>> and such a lib. I'm not going to try to make a general benchmark, I only want what's faster for my application.
I could just use map like everyone else, but -and I don't know I'm talking about- I fear for too many cache misses. My wild, uneducated guess is that my app, doing few, grouped inserts and many scattered searches, would benefit from more compact and contiguous keys.
As a matter of fact, if I was to code the thing, I'd do it with two classes. An unsorted version with only fast, push_back inserts permitted, then a transformation into a sorted version that would take the unsorted version, sort it, maybe check for duplicity, and then allow fast searches and slower, sorted inserts. This is actually Scott Meyers' Effective STL's  Item 23: ""Consider replacing associative containers with sorted vectors"".
Edit: As pointed out by the Boost documentation about flat_(multi)map/set, Matt Austern, not Scott Meyers first suggested replacing maps and sets with vectors: http://lafstern.org/matt/col1.pdf

12353429,"prevent gcc from searching the current dir ""-I-"" option on include search path","
Our dev environment makes heavy use of directories with locally modified headers that should be seen by the compiler instead of the ""committed"" ""repository"" versions.
If header A includes header B, gcc looks for B in the same directory A was in and does not obey the seach path.
So we used the -I- option on gcc to prevent that. Gcc will strictly follow the hierarchy of the include-path then.
As with gcc4 the -I- option is deprecated and repaced by -iqoute.
I can't figure out how to get the same behaviour with the -iquote option because I think it is lacking the side-effect of disabling the search in the ""current"" directory.

Given several sets of elements, e.g.:
Where order matters (i.e. 1, 2, 3 is different to 2, 1, 3), what is an efficient algorithm to locate a specific set? E.g., you want to locate:
Considerations:

Insertion cost for new sets is not an issue, so they can be stored in any data structure, in order to optimize search time.
The sets will contain anywhere between 1 and 1,000,000 elements each (approximately, and there will be anywhere between 1 and 1000 sets (again, approximately). However the number of elements will always be the same for any given set of sets (e.g. if one set has 10 elements, then all sets will have 10 elements).

Follow-up question, I'll be implementing this in C++ so I'd be interested to find out for any recommended algorithms, whether they exist in an open source C++ library (preferably STL, Boost, or QT, but I'll consider others too).

15867874,C++ Boolean Value always incorrectly returns true in 2-3 Tree Search,"
I'm literally ripping my hair out on this one fellas. Here's the problem. I've hard coded a 2-3 Tree and verified that it works with the use of an inorder traversal function that outputs the values of the node it's currently in. So I know the tree is built correctly.
Output would be: 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160
So that proves the tree is built correctly. I've been asked to modify the code to search for a value in the tree. so I wrote this function below, that's essentially the inorder traversal function minus the outputs and a simple if statement that returns TRUE if the search key is found in the tree. 
The user is prompted for a number to search for (int key), and upon entry enters an if statement
Now the problem is that this seems logically sound to me, and yet when I enter the value ""85"" (which is not located on the tree AT ALL), the program outputs ""85 is found!"". Notice how it didn't output the COUT statement I have in the function.cout<<""The node: ""<<r.small<<"" is equal to search key: ""<<key<<endl; I've debugged and stepped through the program and no matter what the bool function (retrieve) always returns true... What? So I switched the if statement in the bool function to return false (just for debugging purposes) upon entering ""60"" (which IS located on the tree), the boolean function STILL returns true. I've tried several combinations of slightly different code but to no avail.. What the heck is going on?? 
Thanks in advance,

15843296,What is an efficient algorithm to compare two large lists of data in C++?,"
I have two lists of times in nanoseconds.  Each list can have 10^12 elements or more.  My current implementation is to take a subset of both lists, compare the times in that subset using for loops and output correlated times, then take another subset.  For each subset comparison this runs in approx. (m*n) where m is the size of list 1 subset and n is the size of the list 2 subset, which is obviously a bad algorithm.
I also have a clock that is smaller than the total time of my data sets, so there are rollovers in the data to be concerned with at certain times.
List 1 has certain events, and list two has secondary events.  I want to know if the secondary events happen within a certain time from the primary events.  There is also a lot of noise, so I need to create a histogram of correlated times and look for a time where there is a statistically significant signal.  
I would like to know if there is a known efficient algorithm that can be used in C++ from any open source library, or an efficient algorithm that I can implement, to search the times of both lists, and output the items that fall within the window.
Here is an example of the brute force function:

15713452,Recommended improved match-finding algorithm for Bejeweled game?,"
I'm trying to determine a sensible method of finding matches of 3, 4, or 5, for each rows and column.  The player looks for areas (rows or columns) in the game board where the same ""gem"" will, after swapping two adjacent pieces (one swap each turn), repeat for 3-5 consecutive spots.
Here's an example scenario of a match-making move:

Board before player move (bolded is necessary swap):
A C B B C
D D B A D
D A A C C
A D B B A
D C D A A
Board after player move (bolded is resulting match):
A C B B C
D D B A D
D A A C C
D A B B A
D C D A A

In this example, there is a 4-match of ""D"" in the first column, after the first row.  I'm trying to figure out how to find such matches after 1.) the board is created at the start of the game and the board randomizes a number of times to eliminate immediate matches, and 2.) after the player makes a move.  If working correctly, the program will be able to detect a match after the correct swap is made by the program itself or the player.
Every algorithm I've attempted have caused the looping to go out of bounds and/or improperly find all resulting matches after a swap.  By this, I mean that the program would sometimes try to search outside the array because I'm unsuccessfully telling the program how to ""adjust"" its array-searching based on where the current spot is.  Even when it does not cause runtime errors, it still shows improper results.  For instance, the player will see that the board has at least one complete match shown, which isn't good.
Here are explanations for two procedures I've attempted:

Following spaces.  From the current spot, check ahead four spaces across in same row (or less if there's less than four spaces remaining in the row).  First check for a match of five, including the current spot; if none, check for four (minus a spot); if none, check for three (minus a spot); if none, no match found.  Repeat the same check for the below column.
Preceding spaces.  From the current spot, check back four spaces across in same row (or less if there's less than four spaces in between the first spot in the row and the current spot).  First check for a match of five, including the current spot; if none, check for four (minus a spot); if none, check for three (minus a spot); if none, no match found.  Repeat the same check for the above column.

Here's the primary function where such working algorithm is needed.  The use of my Gem class here (which is currectly broken) may not be important to the request, so I won't add it unless it's helpful.

14467396,Fast in string search,"
I have a problem that I am looking for some guidance to solve the most efficient way. I have 200 million strings of data ranging in size from 3 characters to 70 characters. The strings consist of letters numbers and several special characters such as dashes and underscores. I need to be able to quickly search for the entire string or any substring within a string (minimum substring size is 3). Quickly is defined here as less than 1 second.
As my first cut at this I did the following:

Created 38 index files. An index contains all the substrings that start with a particular letter. The first 4mb contains 1 million hash buckets (start of the hash chains). The rest of the index contains the linked list chains from the hash buckets. My hashing is very evenly distributed. The 1 million hash buckets are kept in RAM and mirrored to disk.
When a string is added to the index it is broken down into its non-duplicate (within itself) 3-n character substrings (when n is the length of the string-1). So, for example, ""apples"" is stored in the ""A"" index as pples,pple,ppl,pp (substrings are also stored in the ""L"" and ""P"" indexes).

The search/add server runs as a daemon (in C++) and works like a champ. Typical search times are less than 1/2 second.
The problem is on the front end of the process. I typically add 30,000 keys at a time. This part of the process takes forever. By way of benchmark, the load time into an empty index of 180,000 variable length keys is approximately 3 1/2 hours.
This scheme works except for the very long load times. 
Before I go nuts optimizing (or trying to) I'm wondering is whether or not there is a better way to solve this problem. Front and back wildcard searches (ie: string like '%ppl%' in a DBMS are amazingly slow (on the order of hours in MySQL for example) for datasets this large. So it would seem that DBMS solutions are out of the question. I can't use full-text searches because we are not dealing with normal words, but strings that may or may not be composed of real words.

Please explain the whole process clearly, on using vectors for this purpose. Problem is following:--- A Company is connected to n cities numbered from 1 to n. Currently the Headquarter of company is situated at index hq1. Each pair of connected cities are connected both ways. The connection is such that there is exactly one connection from the Headquarter to each city. The map of the connected cities is kept in the following way: for each city i, different from the Headquarter, there is kept number ci — index of the last city on the way from the Headquarter to i.
The company decided to move the Headquarter from city hq1 to city hq2. So, after this change the old representation of the map as described above became incorrect. Please, help the company to find out a new map in the way described above.
Input
The first line contains the number of test cases(0 < T <= 10 ). The next line contains three space-separated integers n, hq1, hq2 (2 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^4, 1 ≤ hq1 ≠ hq2 ≤ n) — number of connected cities, index of the old Headquarter and index of the new Headquarter, respectively.
The following line contains n - 1 space-separated integers — the old representation of the map. For each city, other than hq1, there is given integer ci — index of the last city on the way from the Headquarter to city i. All the cities are described in order of increasing indexes.
Output
Output n - 1 numbers — new representation of the map in the same format. The solution is given below.

I have a very large but lexicographically ordered textfile in which I need to find entries as fast as possible. In order to not traverse the whole thing for a specific entry, I stored certain key positions, such as a-->0, b-->4092 etc, where the character is the first occurrence of itself, and the number is its position, which is obtained by parsing the whole file once with getline() and adding the length of each string into a count-variable. The goal is, that i can jump through the file with seekg(pos) to localize the search a bit. It also seems to work, but sometimes it doesn't and I came here to ask why. The relevant code looks more or less like this:
The second getline is there just in case the stream jumped to the end of a line.
In the first case, there is no output. Just an empty string. In the second case, the output is a normal line from the text file. The file itself contains no empty lines.
I am a bit at a loss. First I thought that maybe the fpos datatype (which is used inside seekg) just is very small and cannot handle numbers above ~10.000, but then I happened to get a valid lookup from the 99.000 range. Has anyone ever had a similar problem?
edit: I just found a possible reason for the problem. In another thread which dealt with seekg, it was advised to reopen the ifstream in order to clear failflags. I did that, and now at least subsequent calls produce something. This tells me, that apparently soemthing goes wrong while calling txtFile.seekg(pos1, txtFile.beg);, but it isn't end of file.
edit 2: I just checked, the failbit is set after a getline call which doesn't get anything.

16419663,writing DFS iterator for graph,"
I am stucked with implementing C++ iterator for graph, which is represented by adjacency list. 
So, the idea is that my iterator should go through the graph by using DFS algorithm. 
As an example, for ++ iterator goes to the next unvisited vertex for current vertex (like in simple DFS). 
My templates for graph vertex and iterator are simple:
Things that I suppose:
In struct vertex should be:

pointer graph_vertex* to the vertex, which was iterated (++'ed) to
this (current) vertex (to return back from current vertex).
I will name it graph_vertex* predecessor_vertex;
successor() and predecessor() functions, which will return
      pointers graph_vertex* to the next / previous ( for DF-search ) vertices .
If I think in a correct way, now I got a ++ and -- for my dfs_iterator ( overloaded functions of ++/-- shall return successor() / predecessor() for current vertex stored in iterator (and of course, change marked flag for current vertex )

But I  don't understand how to deal with situation, when user creates a lot of iterators for one graph, then graph_vertex info will corrupt because marked flags will not respond correctly (one iterator can change it, then second is unable to iterate through this vertex). Should I store a special vector of marked flags in each iterator, and not in vertex? Or duplicate this information somehow to graph_vertex flag ? 
Should I overload some other operators for this iterator ?
Please, give me some tips about my code and such implementation. Do I think in a right way?

Mainly, I was wondering if it was possible to search through the text file without writing the entire text file to an array, finding just the block of information in question and writing that to an array for edit.

22082810,Search a Vector of Classes by a member of the Class,"
Background:
Actual Code: https://github.com/lmwunder/ElectorateProgram
I'm writing a basic program that stores election information as part of an assignment for Data Structures. It is supposed to allow users to track candidates and the votes that they've received. Users can add, edit, or remove candidates from the election information list, and the list itself can be saved or loaded. Users can also create new lists.
Data Structures:
Candidates are represented as follows:

Candidates are further stored in a vector of another class:
Question:
When the users wants to edit or remove a candidate, I prompt them for the name of the candidate, which is a std::string. However, I don't exactly see how I can search the std::vector of candidates using only the name of the candidate. The most obvious way for me is to instantiate temporary ""match"" candidate object with the name data provided inside, and use that to compare against all std::vector members.
Ideally, I'm going for something like this:

Thank you. This is solved. Here is the solution I used.

Then position is 5.
Seen this is a sorted vector, I don't want to use find(), cause it will search from the starting point every time. I want to use binary_search() --- http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/binary_search/, but binary_search will return bool only.

21845819,Search many strings over a very large text,"
I have like 2 million strings and I need to search each of them over a 1 TB text data. Searching all of them is not a best solution to do, so I was thinking about a better way to create a data structure like trie for all of the strings. In other words, a trie in which each node in that is a word. I wanted to ask, is there any good algorithm, data structure or library (in C++) for this purpose?

Let me be more descriptive in this question fellows,
For instance, I have these strings:
s1- ""I love you""
s2- ""How are you""
s3- ""What's up dude""
And I have many text data like:
t1- ""Hi, my name is Omid and I love computers. How are you guys?""
t2- ""Your every wish will be done, they tell me...""
t3
t4

t10000
Then I want to consider each of texts and search for each of strings on them. At last for this example I would just say: t1 contains s1 and nothing else.
I am looking for an efficient way to search for strings but not foolishly for each of them each time.

21608112,Fast search via index with keeping insertion order in C++,"
I need a container which has ability to search over 1 million items pretty fast and keep the insertion order. 
So first I thought about std::map but it doesn’t care about the insertion order it orders the data according to the key. 
An I found boost::multi_index which shall preserve the insertion order and search for the data fast via the indexed field (which is id (not unique!) for my case). So I did something like that:
I can push data into the container without any problem. Let’s say I insert 5 item to my container like:
The problem is when I perform a search in my container for the item “1001” the iterator++ returns ""1002"" and the iterator— returns ""1000"". So it seems that it doesn’t care about the insertion order and orders the data according to the indexed value as well.
I expect results for the iterator++ : “1002” and for iterator-- :  “1005”. I mean the data according to the insertion order. 
Am i doing smth wrong? How can I achieve something like doing fast search via the index value and retreiving the data according to the insertion order.

The problem is:
     Before some days a new road has been constructed.The length of the road is infinite to the left and right side.There are lot of applications for the  kiosks installation in the road and every owner has a preferable position in the road to install his kiosk(an integer variable a[i]),but every kiosk in the road has to be far away at most k from the previous position.There are more than one applications in each position(b[i]).The question is to find the minimum distance that is needed for the kiosk which has to travel the most.The input is n=the number of coordinates, k=the distance of two successive  kiosks, a[i]=coordinates of the applications,b[i]=the number of applications.The output should be a decimal number of double precision which denote the minimum distance of the kiosk who has traveled the most.The a[i] integers are discrete and sorted in ascending order.Lets consider for example the input: 
3 2
0 1
3 2
6 1
output:1.00

0 3

which returns true if there is an element with:
k1_1<=k1<=k1_2 and k2 >= 100
I proposed a binary search tree based on key k1; then search2 is implemented by finding LCA (lowest common ancestor) for k1_1 and k1_2. and searching in the sub-tree rooted by the LCA for a node within k2>=100. So all operations take O(logn).

Right now I think I have covered all the boundary issues, but searches for 1 and 42 come back as not found which I can't explain.
Note: If index = -1 that means that the searchKey has not been found in the array

42 should be returned as index on the first pass.
1 should be returned as index on the fourth pass.

Both return as index = -1

25835587,Find element in OpenCV Mat efficiently,"
Say I need to find a specific element in a cv::Mat which can be a row vector in my case (though for more general case Mat can be more than one dimension).
The data type of the target can be as simple as char, int, double etc.
There is an existing post: How to find if an item is present in a std::vector? which explained how to find the element in a std::vector. Therefore, one way to do this can be: 1) converting the cv::Mat to std::vector; 2) used the method in the post to find the element.
However, I need to do this searching operation hundreds of times per row. When I have hundreds of rows need to be processed, the performance can be an issue.
I am wondering how's the performance of above method (convert + search) and is there any more efficient way to do this (maybe search element directly using cv::Mat without conversion)?

25247069,Searching in large memory mapped files,"
I have a large data structure stored in memory mapped file. Data structure is very simple:
This header is placed in the beginning of the file, it uses a structure hack - variable sized structure, size of the last element is not set in stone and can be changed.
Memory mapped region starts with Header and Header::index_size contains correct length of the Header::index array. This array contains offsets of the data elements, we can do this:
All the data elements is sorted (less than relation defined for data elements). Their are stored in the same memory mapped region as Header but starting from the end to the beginning. Data elements can't be moved, because their are of variable size, instead of that - indexes in header are moved during sort procedure. This is very much like B-tree page in modern databases, index array is usually called an indirection vector.
Searches
This data-structure is searched with interpolation search algorithm (with limited amount of steps) and than with binary search. First, I have a whole index array to search, I'm trying to calculate - where searched element can be stored if distribution is uniform. I get some calculated index - look at element at this index and it usually doesn't match. Than I narrow the search range and repeat. Number of interpolation search steps is limited by some small number. After that data-structure is searched with binary search. This works very good with small data-sets, because distribution is usually uniform. Few iterations of the interpolation search and we're done.
Problem definition.
Memory mapped region can be very large in reality. For testing I use 32Gb file backed storage and search for some random keys. This is very slow because this pattern cause lot of random disk reads (all data can't be cached in memory).
What can be done here? I think that setting MADV_RANDOM with madvise syscall can help, but probably not very much. I want to get on par with B-tree search speed. Maybe it is possible to use mincore syscall to check what data-elements can be painlessly checked during interpolation search? Maybe I can use prefetching of some sort?

Say I have a vector<MyClass>, and a GetMyClass(), like:
This is very conventional, the user calls it and check the return value is nullptr or not. But bad things happen if the user forgot to check. The nullptr check is annoying, and is not always happening. Besides, this function is kind-of a mix of both checking (if there is any valid MyClass) and getting (one MyClass).
P.S. MyClass.condition() == true; is just a simplification, real case could be more complicated.
So I came across to make 2 functions:
If the user wants to know the existence of MyClass then he calls HasMyClass();
If the user wants to get one MyClass and is very sure there must be one, then he calls GetMyClass() directly. If the user wants one MyClass but is not sure, then he calls both of them.
To eliminate code duplication and to avoid redundant execution, I modify it to be:
My question is:

24989455,Is a binary search a good fit for OpenCL?,"
I'm writing an OpenCL program that - among other things - needs to check a calculated (int) value against a whitelist. My plan was to store the whitelist in constant or shared memory, and then have each thread run a Binary Search using this shared whitelist.
Then I read about things like bank conflicts, where threads are slowed down because they're accessing memory on the same bank, which causes a serialization of access to occur.
Is a binary search going to result in a larger performance loss on OpenCL due to issues like this? Would I be better off with some other search algorithm, like a hash?
Edit
Let me clarify my program a bit:
Each thread will do a parralel calculation, but with a different input value. Thus, each thread will get a different output. Each output needs to be checked against the same whitelist.
The kernel will return a bool value that indicates the result of the search.
My concern is that, since each thread is doing an independent binary search, multiple threads will wind up accessing the same bank of the whitelist, causing a serial slowdown.

This is an assignment in my advanced C++ class, we're going over pointers and dynamically allocated arrays, though that doesn't seem to be where my trouble lies...
Function header, Quote, Words, and Count are the important arrays, NumWords just holds a count of how many elements are in the Quote array.
Variables and such, some of the arrays are being passed by pointer from main.
What follows is a priming read for the For loop coming up.  I'm creating two dynamically allocated arrays, one to store a new found instances of a word in the Quote array, and another to store a count of how many times that word appeared in the Quote array.  All this seems to be working fine, but I don't like how large everything is (Code Bloat) any advice to get this started differently would be excellent.
First dynamic array for char's.
Second dynamic array for int's.
This for loop is supposed to use the new value in the **char array, iterate through Quote to find other instances of that value, and increments Count at the same index number for that element.  Seems to work...
Counters for how many words have been stored in the Words array, and where in the Quote array the function is.
This is where things start to go wonky...
I feel this has become far more complicated than it needs to be.  I tried nesting For-loops to begin with, but I couldn't seem to get that working either.  Another thing is, once it copies a word from Quote to Words, it shouldn't copy that word again.
Also, general input on code quality and such would be appricated.  I'm striving to become a software engineer later in life, and I like to be the best at what I do, so I need to learn as much as I can all the time.

For a word-building game I'm working on, I have a trie that stores every possible word from a dictionary. That's about 179,000 at the moment.
The way the game works, there's a 5x5 (or possibly larger in the future, depending on how efficient the solution to this question turns out to be) grid of letters. The player and the PC take turns making words from those letters, getting points based on the letters and length of the words (the letter valuations are similar to Scrabble, but that's not important). Whenever a player makes a word, those letters are removed from the board, and this continues until no words can be made, at which point the grid is reset (and the winner of the round gets a bonus).
The question is this: given a 5x5 grid of letters and that dictionary trie, how can I efficiently determine either the longest word that can be made or a list of all possible words? Note that the letters don't need to be touching each other to be used; any of the grid's letters are fine.
The only way I can think is to essentially do a BFS on the trie, pruning it when the next letter isn't in the grid, but that doesn't seem very efficient to me as it'd have to be tried for each letter in the grid. Is there a better way to do this?

and when I perform a search with 109354 I'm expecting to find the item 4 because it is the first item whose predecessor is smaller then the search criteria. 
Is it possible to imlpement this kind of special searching mechanism with index for fast searching instead of searching the whole array and look for the condition one by one? (the array can have more than 100000 items)

29397793,Binary Search Tree; Self Organizing Search/Rotation C++,"
For my project I am to create a Self-Organizing Binary Search Tree. I have successfully created the BST but for some reason I can't quite figure out how to implement the Organizing portion.
To be more specific, 
When I perform a search for a value, I am to increment its search count. Once the search count equals the ""Thresh hold Value"" (set through the constructor) I rotate that searched node up one.
I am confident I can figure out how to perform the rotation but my problem lies with the integer variables searchCount and threshVal. For some reason, I can't figure out how to get searchCount to only increment with the searched value, and reset when I search for a new value
For example:
I have ""1 2 3 4 5"" in my BST. I perform a search for the value ""3"", I find it, increment the search count to 1.
Then, I perform another search, this time on the value ""5"". The searchCount variable is then incremented again to 2, when it should be 1 since I searched for a different value.
Here is my Search function. It's a big .cpp file so I'll just include the one function.
If I need to give y'all more info, or perhaps add the rest of the .cpp file let me know. Thank you!

29256601,Search a sequence in a string. DNA,"
I need to do a program that separate from 3 to the size of a string and compare to the others sequences of 3 in the same string given. I'm going to explain it.
User introduce this DNA string  = ""ACTGCGACGGTACGCTTCGACGTAG"" For example.
We start with n = 3, this is, we take the first three caracters for comparing in the DNA.
The first characters are: ""ACT"", and we need to compare it with the other sequences of three, like, [CTG,TGC,GCA... until the end]. 
If we find another sequence equal to ""ACT"", we save the position.
Here is another example:
DNA: ""ACTGCGACGGTACGCTTCGACGTAG"" and we find this sequences in his positions:

ACG: 7 - 12 - 20
CGA: 5 - 18
GAC: 6 - 19
GTA: 10 - 22
CGAC: 5 - 18
GACG: 6 - 19
CGACG: 5 - 18
The number is the position of the start of the sequence:

ACTGCGACGGTACGCTTCGACGTAG
You can see that the n = 3, increment in 1 when the we end to find by n = 3, the variable pass to n=4, until n = DNA.size().
My problem is that i have one function for divide the string in a little sequences of the DNA, and I do a push_back() for saving in the vector, and then I can see if there is more sequences or not, but i don't know how can i get the position.
I can use the library algorithm, and for sure, in this library there is a function that do this but i don't know so much this library.

When performing a breadth first search on a directed graph, and we begin at vertex 1 in the picture below, will vertex 0 ever be visited?
Also, can you guys please confirm with me if I have the concept of BFS? So if we started at v1, we first consider all unexplored paths (in this case the paths from v1 to v4, and v1 to v2, but NOT v1 to v0 because it isn't possible), then we visit the vertices v4 and v2, and order does not matter. Then, depending on which ever vertex was last visited, we check for unexplored paths (if we're at v4, the unexplored path would be from v4 to v5, so we travel along that and then visit v5). After that, we check v2 for unexplored paths, in this case v2 to v3, and visit v3. Now v3 does not have any other unexplored paths so we check v5, which also does not have any unexplored paths. Now do we end our BFS? Or can we somehow visit v0?
Also, if instead we had used a DFS and started at v1, would we then eventually visit v0? If DFS was used, would the order of vertices visited, assuming v2 is left of v1, be v1,v2,v3,v4,v5, and then v0?

I have a simple std::vector containing some numbers, which are sorted (in ascending order). I want to lookup an element, so far I use:
return std::lower_bound(vec.begin(), vec.end(), needle);

Where needle is the element I look for. However, my vector tends to be quite long (millions of elements), but most of the time the contents are relatively predictable in a sense that if the first element is zero and the last element is N, then the elements in between have value close to (N * index) / vec.size() and are hence predictable.
Is there a modification of the lower bound, which would accept a hint (similarly to how std::map::emplace_hint() does), such as:
assert(!vec.empty());
std::vector<int>::iterator hint = vec.begin() + std::min(vec.size() - 1,
    (needle * vec.size()) / vec.back());
if(*hint > needle)
    return std::lower_bound(vec.begin(), hint, needle);
else
    return std::lower_bound(hint, vec.end(), needle);

This will work, but the lower_bound ignores that it is close to the solution and will most likely start splitting the interval to halves (looking where we know that the needle most likely isn't), taking unnecessarily many steps. I know that there was an algorithm which starts with step 1, which it doubles until it overshoots the needle, and then does binary search in the given interval.

There are approximately 50000 queries.
I have solution, but it is slow for my context system.
My algorithm is:

Sort search objects by search_field.
Find lower_index, where search_object[lower_index] = Number (lower_bound() function, it is a binary search)
Iterate over array of objects from lower_index to the end of the array. If this_object has index between left_index and right_index, then true. Otherwise, false. 
Repeat steps 2-3 for all search queries (left_index, right_index and Number).

Now I have extracted some words from the regex. The intersection of line numbers of these words as the key in out previous dict gives us a list of line numbers which have all of these words. Now i do re.search or eqv just on these lines, which is very fast as compared to the first method mentioned for my data set.
Are you guys aware of any better method to solve this problem??
I may not need a perfect solution. A miss here and there can be tolerated. Please let me know if more information is needed.

I have some algorithms set up to split the string by delimiter (comma) and return a vector with the first entry being the name, and the second being the value. When using these algorithms to print the name, the name of the variable is successfully printed (in this case, ""test""). however, attempting to use this same variable in a linear search algorithm, the variable is ""test,123"" instead of just ""test"". Below is the code that is causing this error.
Below is the search algorithm.
When the user initializes a variable (in this case, with the name of ""test"", and the value of ""123""), the first cout statement prints ""test"".

Suppose I have a sorted vector of numbers from 0 to 1. I want to know the indices, where values become larger than multiples of 0.1 (i.e. the deciles. in the future maybe also percentiles).
A simple solution I have in mind is using std::lower_bound:
Since the vector can be long, I was wondering if this can be made faster. A first optimisation is to not search the part of the vector below the previous decile:
But, assuming lower_bound performs a binary search, this still scans the entire upper part of the vector for each decile over and over again and doesn't use the intermediate results from the previous binary search.
So ideally I would like to use a search function to which I can pass multiple search items, somehow like:
is there anything like this already around and existing in standard, boost, or other libraries?

30520865,Highlight text that matches a search string in Qt5,"
First let me explain what I'm trying to achieve:
In your browser, hit Ctrl + f and type ""q"". The result of that operation is what I'm trying to achieve. It seems like this should be a solved problem, but despite the many hours I've spent researching, reading documentation, and asking around in the Qt IRC, I'm still stuck. Maybe somebody here will be able to give me a hand.
The following Qt classes are what I'm currently dealing with, in case you want to brush up a bit.:
Qt::DisplayRole
QModelIndex::data
QAbstractItemView::setDelegate
QTextEdit::setExtraSelections (only as a reference)
QAbstractDocumentLayout::Selection
QTextDocument::drawContents
QStyledItemDelegate::paint
QStyleOptionViewItem
QStyleOption::rect
QTableView
QAbstractItemModel::match
Learn to Model/View Program with Qt
So now, let me explain how I have things set up, and what the results of my research and interactions with the Qt IRC has lead me to believe I should do.
I am using a QStandardItemModel along with a QTableView. Each row that gets appended to the QStandardItemModel has several columns. As we know, each of these columns is represented in the QStandardItemModel as a QModelIndex. We can pull its displayed text by accessing its data(Qt::DisplayRole).
Conveniently, given a search string, QStandardItemModel::match will return a QModelIndexList of every QModelIndex that, well, matched in the column. Of course, if you have several columns in every row, you would need to preform this match over each column, but I can worry about performance here later.
So cool, that problem is solved. We have our list of every QModelIndex that had a matching string. Now, what I want to do is highlight that string in each column. For example:
Search string: ""col""
This is a column | This is aColumn | This is aColumn | This is a co
Parts that would appear highlighted are what I have in bold above. In order to achieve this, I knew from reading the Model/View docs that I needed to subclass a QStyledItemDelegate and reimplement its paint function. So I started there.
The next problem to solve would be, how in the world to select a specific piece of text in the DisplayRole and only highlight it? You can't use Qt::BackgroundRole, that would set the entire index's background color. Enter QTextDocument.
I still need to do more digging to see how exactly I can implement that behavior, but from what I was told in Qt IRC, QTextEdit has a function called setExtraSelections. Looking at how that is implemented, it leverages QAbstractTextDocumentLayout::Selection and various cursor functions available to me in QTextDocument.
However, sadly I cannot even begin to solve that problem, because the first step is to actually ensure that I can render a QTextDocument to the QTableView  with my reimplemented custom delegate paint function. This is where I'm stuck currently. I've seen this post, here and the one it references:
Similar question that doesn't solve my issue
Its not exactly what I was looking for, but I figured it would help me at least get something rendering. It looks though like in his code, he's drawing the control (which is literally what QStyledItemDelegate does), and then tries to paint his QTextDocument over it. Maybe that's not what that is doing but it sure looks like it.
In any case, when I tried that, it looked like the QTextDocument had no effect. If I commented out the drawControl call, then no text would be rendered at all. Here is my code for that:
You can see I just typed text ""Things"" to see if I could just get that to render. To no avail.
Before summarizing my question I want to mention that no, I cannot use a QTextEdit. There are specific columns that I need to word wrap, while others I do not want to word wrap. QTableView displays the data exactly as I expect to see it.
So my question is this:
Is the QTextDocument rendering through the paint event of a subclassed QStyledItemDelegate the preferred way to handle this? If not, how else should I deal with it?
If so, how do I make it work as I expect? What is wrong with the code that I have?
Bonus 2 parter question
Once I can render, how can I actually leverage the QTextDocument API to highlight only specific pieces, given that the list of model indexes that contain the text to be highlighted is discovered in a completely different function and at a different time than when the paint function executes?
Update 0
Using the QTextDocument API to make multiple selections is looking like an impossible feat. The column that I would be drawing contents to needs to word wrap and expand. 
From what I can tell, I calling drawContents manually means handling resizing, word wrapping, and many other things manually which is not a path I want to go down if that is indeed the case.
I've got another way in mind, I will update if it works.
Update 1
I have accomplished what I want in another way. Unfortunately, I cannot use Qt for what I want. Qt's Model/View system is entirely too inefficient and getting it to do what I need causes it to be extremely and unacceptably slow. How did I accomplish the highlighting?
I will describe in an answer. If nobody gives me a better answer, I will pick mine as the best.

You are given a list of word. Find if two words can be joined to-gather to form a palindrome. eg Consider a list {bat, tab, cat} Then bat and tab can be joined to gather to form a palindrome. 
Expecting a O(nk) solution where n = number of works and k is length 
There can be multiple pairs, just return true if found one.
Also, in the comments one of the approaches was this:
1) Add the first word to the trie ( A B)
2) Take the second word (D E E D B A) and reverse it (A B D E E D)
3) See how many letters in the reversed word you can match in the trie (the first 2)
4) Take the rest of the string (D E E D) see if it is a palindrome if it is you are done return true
5) add the second word to the trie (D E E D B A)
6) go back to step 2 with the next word
7) when out of words return false
But in my opinion this is not an O(nk) solution.
Can anyone suggest a solution?? Or explain why the algorithm described above is O(nk)??

29836750,Getting Stuck On the Algorithm for q bishops on an n*n chessboard,"
I'm using C++, but my question is more about algorithms than implementation.
The problem is the following:

Write a program that inputs two integers n and k, where n>=k. Your program should calculate the number of different ways that k bishops could be placed on an nXn chessboard.

My basic idea is to represent each bishop as a struct with an X value and a Y value. Then I place the bishops on the board to get a configuration.
I have written a method called moveToNextPlace that allows me to move a bishop into the next available spot. I return a string to help with debugging.
I then set the board to an initial configuration by calling findSolutions with my desired settings.
I then want to keep backtracking until I have a total number of solutions, but I get stuck on how to find the next solution.
I thought I could write a findNextSolution that keeps getting called at the end of the findSolutions function until it reaches a cycle. But I don't know what algorithm to use to find the next solution.

<>fauve:
""--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------""
Definition of fauve:
1 : of or relating to painters practicing fauvism
2 : vivid in color
Example 1 of fauve:
""Fauve colors brought sizzle back to tableware, but could you really
  eat off a Rorschach of orange, black and pink?"" - Julie V. Iovine, The
  New York Times Magazine, 14 Mar. 1993
Example 2 of fauve:
""Three were landscapes.. The other was a later painting of Adele, pale
  and strained, standing in a big hat with her arms loose amid fauve
  colours of red, mauve and green."" - The Economist, 19 Feb. 2011
Explanation of fauve:
When French art critic Louis Vauxcelles spotted a statue reminiscent
  of 15th-century Italian art in the midst of works by an avant-garde
  group of painters-principal among them Henri Matisse-at an exhibit in
  Paris in 1905, he verbalized his shock with the words ""Donatello au
  milieu des fauves!"" (""Donatello among the wild animals!""). His
  reaction was to the painters' unconventional use of intensely vivid
  color and free treatment of form, and apparently his words weren't far
  off the mark in describing their art: Matisse and company's art
  movement became known as ""Fauvism"" and the artists flourishing in it,
  the ""Fauves."" In 1967, the intense impact of their colors was still
  vibrant, inspiring one writer for Vogue to use fauve as an adjective
  to describe the colors of a ""striking"" flowered coat-and that use can
  still be found today vivifying colors.

37221232,How to search in a Range Tree?,"
I read several slides, like this one's last page, where the describe the search algorithm. However, I have a basic question. The data lie in a 2D space.
I first build a Binary Search Tree based on the x value of the points. Every inner node holds a BST based on the y value of the points that lie in the subtree of that inner node.
Then I think I should search for the points that lie in the range query [x1, x2] and then check if for that points the requested [y1, y2] range query is satisfied. However, the algorithm suggests that you should search in the y-based BST of an inner node, if the range of the inner node is inside [x1, x2], but I don't get that.

If we do that, then in an example I have, we will search (without a reason) the y-based BST of the root. Check the example:
And the range query I wish to perform is (-oo, 1) x (0, 5)*.
If I look at the root, it has value 0, thus it's enclosed in (-oo, 1), so if I follow the algorithm I am going to search the whole y-based tree of the root?
That should be a tree that contains all the points, so there is no point in continuing searching in x-based tree. Moreover, that will result in more visited nodes than the necessary.

I am implementing that in c++, if that matters.
*Performing a range query for x's in the range [-inf, 1] and y's in the range [0, 5].

I have two arrays within Cuda;
Part of my algorithm requires that I regulary insert new data into the main array from the source array.  If a position within the main array is zero, it assumes it is empty, therefore it can be populated with a value from the source array.

Currently I'm using a modified version of a radix sort, to ""shuffle"" the contents of the main array to the very end of the main array, leaving all zero values at the beginning of the array, making the insertion from source trivial.  The sort has been modified to iterate over a single bit, rather than 32 bits, this works with a simple switch on the input;
I'm wondering if this is already quite an efficient way of doing this?  I'm wondering if I wouldn't gain something by using a tactically deployed atomicAdd such as;

EDIT: We cannot pass container's iterators in the function argument. If we can that is easy. It has to be a container.
I was thinking: Assuming 'Container' is an abstract base class from STL containers (which its not, according to first answer below).

I'm trying to make run time measurements of simple algorithms like linear sort. The problem is that no matter what I do, the time measurement won't work as intended. I get the same search time no matter what problem size I use. Both me and other people who've tried to help me are equally confused.
I have a linear sort function that looks like this:
I've tried to take time measurement with both time_t and chrono from C++11 without any luck, except more decimals. This is how it looks like right now when i'm searching.
The result?
0.126, 0.125, 0.125, 0.124, 0.124, ... (same values?)
I have tried the code with both VC++, g++ and on different computers.
First I thought it was my implementation of the search algorithms that was at fault. But a linear sort like the one above can't become any simpler, it's clearly O(N). How can the time be the same even when the problem size is increased by so much? I'm at loss what to do.

Someone else might have an explanation why this is the case. But it actually worked in release mode after changing:

A brute force approach is too slow for my liking, so I'm looking into various data structures which could help accelerate the search.

Here is one such case:

Notice how the blue point is closest to the large bounding box, but closer to the small green triangle. This makes me feel that data structures relying on bounding boxes would result in incorrect search results...unless I'm missing something obvious?

41863976,Binary search given slightly inaccurate results,"
The problem I am trying to solve is the following: I get N rectangular paper strips with 1cm width and length C. I need to cut the strips at a height where the sum of the areas of the cut strip is equal to A. You can see an example bellow for which N = 5, the strips are of length, 5,3,6,2 and 3 cm and A = 3cm where the cut is made at 4cm.

Note that I'm looking here for the red area.
The input is given as follows. The first line in each case begins with two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5) and A (1 ≤ A ≤ 10^9) representing respectively the number of strips and the expected resulting area. The next line contains N integers, representing the length C_i (1 <= C_i <= 10^4) of each strip.
The input ends with A = C = 0, which should not be processed.
For each test case, output a single line, the height H of the cut that must be done so that the sum of the area of the cut strips is equal to A cm². Print the answer with 4 decimal places. Output "":D"" if no cutting is required, or ""-.-"" if it’s impossible.
This problem can be found here
My idea for solving this problem was to use a binary search where I pick a height in the middle of the strips and make it larger or smaller depending on whether my cut was too high or too low. My implementation of the problem is given bellow:
The problem is, after submitting my answer I keep getting a 10% error. The website has a tool for comparing the output of you program with the expected output so I ran a test file with over 1000 randomly generated test cases and when I compared both I got a rounding error on the 4th decimal case, unfortunately, I don't have the file nor the script to generate test cases for me anymore. I tried changing the acceptable error to a smaller one but that didn't work. I can't seem to find the error, does any of you have an idea of what is happening?

For a given finite set of parameters, p_1, p_2, ... , p_n, I want to be able to search a binary file and retrieve the contents corresponding to the parameters.

One very common is red/black trees. I don't like trees for this problem due to the fact I would have to use dynamic memory among other thins (like storing pointers and associated values I don't need).

I have already tried adapting the answer from this question, but I think I am doing it wrong.
The first line simply converts from a Boost multi-precision cpp_dec_float (named i) to a string. I know that this part of the code works, because I use it effectively elsewhere in the program.
I am trying to check if a string contains more than one period. If the string has more than one period in it, the function returns false.
How can I achieve this?

39467350,C++ if statement order,"
A portion of a program needs to check if two c-strings are identical while searching though an ordered list (e.g.{""AAA"", ""AAB"", ""ABA"", ""CLL"", ""CLZ""}). It is feasible that the list could get quite large, so small improvements in speed are worth degradation of readability. Assume that you are restricted to C++ (please don't suggest switching to assembly). How can this be improved?
You can assume that stringX and stringY are always the same length and you won't get any invalid data input.
From what I understand, a compiler will make the code so that the CPU will check the first if-statement and jump if it's false, so it would be best if that first statement is the most likely to be true, as jumps interfere with the pipeline. I have also heard that when doing a compare, a[n Intel] CPU will do a subtraction and look at the status of flags without saving the subtraction's result. Would there be a way to do the strcmp once, without saving the result into a variable, but still being able to check that result during the both of the first two if-statements?

39092063,Problems implementing recursive best-first search in C++ based on Korf 1992,"
I am having two main issues implementing the algorithm described in this article in C++: properly terminating the algorithm and freeing up dynamically allocated memory without running into a seg fault.
Here is the pseudocode provided in the article:
Here, f(Ni) refers to the ""computed"" function value, whereas F[i] refers to the currently stored value of f(Ni).
Here is my C++ implementation, in which I had to use a global variable to keep track of whether the goal had been reached or not (note, I am trying to maximize my f(n) value as opposed to minimizing, so I reversed inequalities, orders, min/max values, etc.):
My main questions are:

Is there a way to terminate this function than having to use a global variable (bool goal_reached) without a complete re-implementation? Recursive algorithms usually have some kind of base-case to terminate the function, but I am not seeing an obvious way of doing that.
I can't seem to delete the dead-end state (when the state has no children) without running into a segmentation fault, but not deleting it results in unfreed memory (each state object was dynamically allocated). How can I modify this code to ensure that I've freed all of the states that pass through it?

I ran the program with gdb to see what was going on, and it appears that after deleting the dead-end state, the next state that is recursively called is not actually NULL, but appears to be corrupted. It has an address, but the data it contains is all junk. Not deleting that node lets the program terminate just fine, but then many states aren't getting freed. In addition, I had originally used the classical, iterative best-first search (but it takes up far too much memory for my case, and is much slower), and in that case, all dynamically allocated states were properly freed so the issue is in this code somewhere (and yes, I am freeing each of the states on the path in main() after calling rbfs).

39054847,"How much ""if"" statements effect on performance?","
There are a some IPTables with different sizes (e.g  255 or 16384 or 512000!!).Every entry of each table, holds a unique IP Address (hex format) and some other values. The total number of IPs is 8 millions. 
All IPs of all IPTables are sorted
We need to search IPTable 300,000 times per sec. Our current Algorithm for finding an IP is as follow:
As it can be seen, in worst case, number of comparisons for a given IP address is _rangeCount *2 and number of ""if"" statement checking is _rangeCount.
Suppose i want to change the searchIPTable and use more efficient way to find an IP address in IPTables. as far as i know, for a sorted array, the best software implementation of a famous search algorithm like binary search needs log(n) comparisons( in worst case).
So, the number of comparisons to find an IP address is log(8000000) that is equal to ~23.
Question 1:
As it can bee seen there is a little gap between the number of comparison needed by two algorithm ( _rangeCount vs 23) but in first method, there are some ""if"" statement that could effect on performance. if you want to run first algorithm for 10 times, obviously the first algorithm has better performance, but i have know idea about running two algorithm for 3000,000 times! what is your idea?

38503464,"Binary search runs as slow as linear one, plus finding first value","
I'm trying to implement a Density Map, this map is represented by 2D array of n x m dimensions, where each cell has a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of randomly find this cell. For example :
We have a 50% chance to find the coordinates (1,0), 4% chance of finding the coordinates (0,0) and so on.
To find this cell, I use a cumulative sum. The above array would be then represented by :
Since I'm working in C++, I'm using a 1D array of size (n * m), the above is then represented by :
To find a random cell within this probability, I can use this linear method :
Where k is a random number between 0 and 1
This is, however, quite slow since my array is used to represent an image (so it can become quite large), and I have to call this function an unholy amount of times.
To speed up the program, I tried to implement a binary search in my array. This implementation is as follows :
}
The returned index is correct (same as the linear search), but the speed gain is quite bad, and I can't understand why. For example, with a 10 000 x 10 000 randomly filled density map, the search takes 3.172s for the binary search, and 3.288s for the linear one.
Another problem I have with the binary search is that, sometimes, the results can differ a bit. Consider the following example :
In this case, if my random number is 0.90, the linear search will stop at the first occurence of this number (index 2), whereas the binary one will look at the mid index, where the value is also 0.90, so it will return (index 4) as its result, which is not what I want ..
Is there another way to speed up this search and keep the results as I want them ? (Meaning finding the first occurence of a value). I guess I could iterate in reverse once I find a result with the binary search, but I'm afraid it will slow down the program even more, which would be pretty horrendous

38410319,Find all of adjacent cells/cubes in 3D-space,"
I am dividing a part of a 3D space into a series of 1x1x1 cubes, and that part may have a volume of 100^3 up to 1000^3, however, the cubes/cells I am really interested in rarely exceed 5000-20000 in their numbers. 
What I am trying to do is to find all the cells/cubes which satisfy my criteria, adjacent to the chosen one. However, I am not sure what algorithm is the best for such a task. First thing which comes to my mind is to use a regular flood fill algorithm, but the following problem arises: I have to store information about all of the cells in the working area, which as I said may have up to 1000^3 elements, but the ones I need are barely 5000-20000.

38044395,Counting the number of occurrences of an element in an array using recursion,"
I've been given the following prompt:

Create a recursive function that counts the number of times v occurs in the array A by dividing A into two subarrays each time.

What better way to approach this than using BinarySearch? I created the following function:
int count(int *A, int low, int high, int v) {
    if(low > high) return 0;
    int total = 0, mid = (low + high)/2;
    if(A[mid] == v) total++;
    return count(A, low, mid - 1, v) + total + count(A, mid + 1, high, v);
}
This works, so I don't need verification on this part.
We are not told if the array A is sorted or not, so that's why it's necessary to search both the left half and the right half of the array A. But I need to find the time complexity of the function that I've written. Here's what I've thought:
Any variable assignments are O(1), so the only parts we need to consider are count(A, low, mid - 1, v) + total + count(A, mid + 1, high, v). Since we're dividing the array into 2 parts with a subproblem size of 2, I've created the following recurrence relation:

T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1) + T(n/2) = 2T(n/2) + O(1),

which we can use the Master Theorem to give us T(n) = O(n). My question: is my assumption that the variable assignments are constant with O(1) and that each part of the count function is T(n/2) valid?
The overall time complexity we get of O(n) makes sense because we have to check all n elements in the array.

45051401,SIMD Linear Search Slower than Unrolled Loop,"
I'm working on an application for which a highly optimized linear search will make a big difference in the overall performance, and I've been tasked with improving performance as much as I can.
I'm running my search on a vector of 10,000 elements that is bounded by sentinel values at the end, I run the linear search at some constant distance from the target element and measure the time it took to find the element. I choose the target elements randomly from the set of elements what are after that constant distance from the beginning of the array to allow for the beginning of the search. I'm measuring the performance using Google's benchmark framework.
The results that I've collected surprise me. I expected that at some point SIMD would beat an unrolled loop for performance, but the gap between the two appears to be growing as the distance needed to travel the array grows. Additionally, I'm not sure why the loop that has been unrolled 8 times runs faster on shorter distances than the loop unrolled 32 times.
I'm running on an i5-4570, and I've complied with clang 5.0.0. quick-bench doesn't have AVX, and clang doesn't fully unroll in version 3.8, but it should be runnable. I tried unrolling the SIMD also, as well as going to AVX256 instructions, but both made the performance worse. Why is it that the unrolled loop is so much faster? Why is it that the loop with more unrolling performs so dramatically worse than the loop with less unrolling?
The classic diagnosis for SIMD is that you're not doing enough work in SIMD, but I think I'm doing enough work here.

45020315,Efficient way to map a long list of strings to enums,"
(I am not sure how to correctly call my problem. Please edit the title if there as better way to state it)
In an API I'm using I have a certain enumerator type with 2000+ enumarator values. My objective is to have a function that will take in a string and return the corresponding enumerator. (The enumerator values and the strings2 have almost the same names.)
My idea was to have nested if statements like this:
(queriedEntityNameString is a std::string and queriedEntityType is a enum type)
Obviously setting this up for 2000 cases manually is ""impossible"". I could write up a little script that could do this for me, but is this sort script available somewhere?
My second idea was to put everything in a std::map, but I'm not sure how efficient it would be.
I would like any suggestions on the best way to approach this problem.

44871381,"Searching a 2d Vector for a value, then adding the co-ordinates of any elements that match the value to a separate 2d vector.","
The language: C++
Background: I have recently started programming, and am just trying to learn more about c++ so I have very limited knowledge.
The aim: To search through a 2D Vector (e.g testVec) for a value. Once that Value is found I want to store the the co-ordinates of where that value is in testVec (i.e [3][4]) in a separate 2d vector (coOrds).
The Problem: The testVec is being iterated through properly, and the co ordinates are being stored in coOrds, however, the issue is that all the co ordinates of all the elements in testVec are being stored, not just the co ordinates for the element containing specific value.
As far as I can tell, with my limited knowledge I have messed up somewhere in my if statement, but past that I honestly I have no idea what I have done wrong and how to fix it. Any specific help with the code, or general directions towards sources that can help would be much appreciated.

I have two versions of find function, both of which search an integer value in an array and return its position if exists. Function find1() will search up to N elements in worst case on the other hand find2() function will search up to N/2 elements in worst case.

44032649,"find_if for nested tuple, return access to other tuple with same layout","
I've two tuples of identical nesting and layout, but one tuple is read-only and contains only constant data, whereas the other one can change during runtime and is generally accessible by the user.
An example would be the following nested tuple, containing some (template) structs S which hold either two const strings and integers, or a single non-const integer. What stays the same, regardless of which tuple one wants to access, is the index_sequence to get to the desired value.
So far so good. With a lot of useful tuple topics here on SO I've got most things I need covered, but one particular feature I'd like to add keeps bothering me. I'd like to search the const tuple for a specific name string and return whatever helps me access the non-const versions value on the very same position. So, using the example above, I'd like to access the value 42 by searching for ""first_name"". 
In order to achieve that I've tried to write some ""std::find_if"" like function which recursively steps through the tuple and compares the string with a predicate. The general idea is straight forward and looks like this ->
(head is a simple get<0> wrapper and tail ... well, tail returns the tuple without head)
The problem is, currently my ""find_if"" acts more like an ""any_of"". I've tried keeping track of the index_sequence when stepping through tuple, but I simply can't return it because the trailing return type would change with each new index I add or remove...
Is there any solution to this? The only way I could think of so far which would keep ""constexpr-ness"" is to pass an array as another parameter and keep track of the indices there. Since I don't know the actual index sequence length in advance, the array would always have to be the size of the maximum tuple-depth.

I have to sort it first, so to preserve the original indices, I created a 2D array, put the data in the first column and the original indices in the second.

43361993,Dynamically Update Elements of Array (Based on Changes Made to its Other Elements),"
So, I have a 2D vector of cracks on a surface, arranged in no particular order.  If a crack is too close another crack (let's say 3 units), one or both of the cracks must be translated away (maximum amount 8 units).  Type B cracks (which have been identified) will not be modified.  My program so far has the functionality to translate the cracks along or perpendicular to their lines of equation.
The problem arises when I translate a crack away from another, and it gets too close to a different, third crack.  This requires a second translation, and if the issue isn't fixed, a third one as well.  But this gets computationally intensive.  If 278 cracks are moved on the first iteration, and then another 278 on the second, and again on the third, that's already 277^3 = 21,253,933 calculations (for each crack, the distance to 277 other cracks must be calculated) before the translation.  Now it's not always that all 278 cracks will have to be translated, but I need a better algorithm to move all cracks so that they are at least 3 units of distance away from each other.  Even if I try to use a dynamic search neighborhood, it will still have to loop over all 278 cracks.  
Please advise; I'm stuck and I really don't know how to proceed.

The criteria of searching should be according to:
name and address

DeletePerson( ""Jean"", ""street 2"" ));

or
birth certificate number

DeletePerson ( ""701206/2393"" ) );

Note that we may have a substring T in S after removing T. What is the remaining string of S? (It is fine if S is empty.)
Constraint:

1 <= length(S) <= 10^6.
1 <= length(T) <= 100.

For example, S = ""aaabbababbabab"", T = ""abba"". The remaining string is ""ab"".
I'm thinking to use KMP to have a prefix on T. Then when we find a string T in S, we have to change the indices i and j (i for S, and j for T) to new locations. However, I'm not exactly sure what j (and probably i) should be? The string may have a lot of fragments.
Is my approach correct? If so, could you please give me detailed steps how I can do it, especially what would be the new value of j? I stuck at the value of j. I don't know what I should assign j to after finding a match. This is part of the algorithm which I couldn't figure out.

My focus is on the System.Search.QueryFocusedSummary property (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb760171(v=vs.85).aspx), since it's the only (semi-)documented field that should provide what I need. I'm open to a different approach if it is feasible using only .NET (C#) or C++ native code.
I have a working search tool, implemented in C++, that uses the OLE DB API successfully to search
the local Windows machine (assuming indexing is enabled) and return results such as System.ItemName, System.MIMEType, System.Size, etc. As expected, I can
also obtain the System.Search.AutoSummary field, which is basically just the first N characters of human-readable files (like UNIX head). See this Microsoft page for more.
If I understand correctly, the System.Search.QueryFocusedSummary property is ""virtual"" in the sense that it is dynamically created by Windows (at some point in time), and not stored in the Index database. Therefore, it is not accessible using the OLE DB approach.
Although Microsoft officially ""retired"" the Windows API Code Pack, this page (and others linking to it) describes how to use the Windows Search SDK. I followed the Search App example in the de facto Windows API Code Pack repository, and added the QueryFocusedSummary property in place of one of the existing, extracted properties. This had no effect and the property is still empty for all search results.
Does anyone have any insight into how to obtain search snippets from the Windows Search API? I'm concerned only with local client Windows Search.

The second struct is a Graph that has two fields an array of Vertex Struct and an integer for the number of vertices. The problem i have if when the depth first search function is called it never stops even if the stack is empty the depth first function prints each vertices that is visited. Can someone help me with finding a way to make the program stop ones the stack is empty;
The program outputs 
Here is the stack and linkedlist h files

I've implemented A*. However, when it runs, it operates as BFS when all nodes within the vector have equal f-scores. 

There are a number of simple optimizations or implementation details that can significantly affect the performance of an A* implementation. The first detail to note is that the way the priority queue handles ties can have a significant effect on performance in some situations. If ties are broken so the queue behaves in a LIFO manner, A* will behave like depth-first search among equal cost paths (avoiding exploring more than one equally optimal solution)

49711460,Finding matches in a linked list in a queue-like way,"
The task I was given was to read contents of a file into a linked list, then search for matches in a queue-like way and then output them in another file, while deleting matching entries both from LL and input file. Size of the input file tested on can be up to 60k entries.
Our input file contains fields as follows:
Time(an int value from 1 to the size of int)
Action(a char ""A""(ask) or ""B""(bid))
PK(a long long int, always 11 digits)
Name(string, max length 50)
An example of what input file might look is(without header):  
What my program should do is:
Find a matching name and not-matching action(first entry and last entry in the list), and put the following lines in the output file:
Time of last entry PKofA PKofB
Example(first entry and last):

I must find matches in a queue like way, where the first entry output in a file would be ""Dog"" rather than ""Cat"", because Time between them is less so than between both entries of ""Cat"", while keeping in mind that we start with the top of the list to look for matches since they are the earliest.
My idea of resolving this issue was to look through the list once and find all matches, then subtract both times and calculate which match has the least value of time between them and output that first(putting priority on entries which comes first in case time-subtraction values are the same)
But issue is that if there are 60k+ entries in input file it will be awfully slow since I will have to search through list twice, once to find matches and evaluating time to determine which comes first, then again to find the nodes to delete from the linked list.
I tend to needlessly complicate things, but is there perhaps an easier, much quicker way to tackle this problem?

I have a text file which is a trimmed hexdump of a file allocation table, which consists of many lines which look somewhat like:
In this file, I'd like to search for a specific substring of characters. There are a few obstacles with this, however. Typically, I would just use an ifstream and getline(), then apply line.find() to each line until I found/failed to find the substring. With this file, however, it's possible that the target substring will be split across multiple lines. The file is also potentially thousands upon thousands of lines long, making it impractical to trim \n characters from the text file first (it actually bogs down the text editor and leads to strange results if I try). What would be an efficient way to accomplish my search?
EDIT: I also should point out that I actually want to return the position of the matched string, so it's not possible to, say, concatenate 2 lines together at a time, remove just that concatenation's \n character, search, and iterate through if not found. If the match starts on non-whitespace character 15000, I want to return 15000.

I want ask the method for searching pattern in network stream. 
My current method is to allocate a big cache, put data from socket to cache, when the data size exceed a threshold, then start to search all of sync headers (using KMP algorithm) in cache. It works, but looks somehow cumbersome.
The header is very simple flag such as ""0xFFEEBBAA1290"".
Is there a trick to check the header as quick as possible in realtime without accumulation? That is while receiving data, check whether the complete data block is arrived just in time.
The data is arriving continuously and no any interval to indicates different data blcok.
I used the circular buffer to check the first header and next header to decide the whole block, but numerous modulo (for circular buffer index) operations slow down the speed drastically. I just used memcmp to find header.
FYI, My prefer language is C/C++.
Hope to get your advice. Any reference link also welcome.
Thank you.

Please allow me to add some details about this problem.
The data come from a board which is not in my control.
The device send data from arbitray position from his source and don't follow any rule like when connection established must start with a package the header on the front. And even worse the block length is not fixed, I must get block by checking  2 headers.
In my approach, I try to find first header at begin time, if it not meet, I will drop each byte until the header come. 
On this way at least I can gurantee the first header is at the begin of cache(The cache size is much smaller than KMP approach because I don't want search headers in delay), then continue to receive data and check next header simultaneously.
If found the block, the block data will move to other process, then second header will move to front of cache.
It causes the cache should be re-aligned to accept next data, this is why I used the circular buffer (store data to array) to implement. i.e., just set read and write position, not actually move remain data in cache.
list or vector is tried but not used because of byte chunk operations and performance consideration.
The problem is I have to continuously check the next header while data arriving.
Is there an elegant way to avoid such frequent byte scan?
Or if the speed is reasonable I also can accept the frequent byte scan, but the modulo operation for calculating reading and writing position in circular buffer seems slow down the performance.
I used different profiling tool and all indicate the frequent modulo is performance bottleneck.

How do I make a tree data structure in C++ that uses iterators instead of pointers?  I couldn't find anything in the STL that can do this.  What I would like to do is to be able to create and manipulate trees like this:

Thank you, tree.hh seems to be just what I was looking for.

If this is for gaining the benefit of
  a data-structure holding arbitrary
  index types, optimized for searching
  and good at insertion then consider
  using a map.
A map is an associative container that
  has performance guarantees identical
  to those of a tree: logarithmic
  searching, logarithmic insertion,
  logarithmic deletion, linear space.
  Internally they are often implemented
  as red-black trees, although that is
  not a guarantee. Still, as an STL user
  all you should care about is the
  performance guarantees of the STL
  algorithms and data-structures.
  Whether they're implemented as trees
  or little green men shouldn't matter
  to you.

I'm not sure if a map is what I need, but thanks for the info.  I will remember to use maps whenever possible instead of implementing trees.

I've come across this issue a few times and would like find out if there is a simple method or pattern I can use to solve it.
Imagine a tree structure where each node contains a STL container (vector) of pointers to children.  I want client code to be able to traverse this tree, and iterate through the child containers to access other parts.
My problem is that I want to maintain encapsulation for my nodes while at the same time letting clients easily see all of the children for that node. I also want to make sure that if a client gets a const reference to the root node in the tree, then all access to subsequent parts of the tree are also const.
Should I try to make an iterator class for my node type, have a node method return vector iterators , or is there a more elegant pattern I'm missing?
Edit: I want to stress again that while I see some good ideas presented, I have containers of pointers to other nodes.  Returning a vector<node *>::const_iterator will not prevent clients from calling non-const methods on the node.  It only protects the pointers themselves from pointing at different objects.

I can't use one base class and inherite others from it, because all needed controls - is a hierarchy tree (not one class).
So I have one hierarchy tree for WinAPI controls, one for FDK and one abstract tree to use anyone control.  
For example, there is an Edit control (WinEdit and FdkEdit realization), a Button control (WinButton and FdkButton realization) and base entity - Control (WinControl and FdkControl realization).  
For now I can link my classes in realization trees (Win and Fdk) with inheritence between each of them (WinControl is base class for WinButton and WinEdit; FdkControl is base class for FdkButton and FdkEdit). And I can link to abstract classes (Control is base class for WinControl and FdkControl; Edit is base class for WinEdit and FdkEdit; Button is base class for WinButton and FdkButton). But I can't link my abstract tree - compiler swears.  
In fact I have two hierarchy trees, that I want to inherite from another one.
Update:
I have done this quest! :)
I used the virtual inheritence and get such scheme (http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/7782/99614779.png). Abstract tree has only absolute abstract methods.

3852252,How to store OpenGL Primitives in a tree data structure in C++?,"
I'm new to OpenGL and C++. Say I start with a 2D square (on the very left) like shown in the picture below. I want to make it interactive with the glutKeyboardFunc() so when I press a number a new box will draw next to the corresponding edge.

Figure the best way to do this is to have a tree structure that hold all the boxes. But I'm not sure how I can hold basic primitives into a data structure, a tree, for instance. 
I'm aware that I can only call the glutDisplayFunc(myDisplay) once, and the rest should handle by the glutKeyboardFunc() 
Any help would be appreciated :)
Update: thanks for pointing out glutPostRedisplay() but what if I want to make the box selectable and keep tracking the current selected box with glutMouseFunc(), and from there when I add more boxes, I need to know how many child box it has created, so I can provide the right position when new box is drawn. Seems that makes more sense now to use a tree data structure ? Just not sure how I can store the information I need into a tree.

Currently I sort R by y then x, then go through every pair (a, b) and test whether a is a child of b. Not only is this not very efficient, but it also doesn't work correctly: I figured that since R is already sorted, the last parent found should be the immediately enclosing one, but this doesn't seem to hold.

 [A]             / \               [A]

3131671,C++ tree of pointers template question,"
I've just come across a nice STL-like tree container class written by Kasper Peeters:
http://tree.phi-sci.com/
However, because it's STL-like, it's geared towards having a single class type in the tree; i.e. template <class T>.  The trouble is, like STL-lists, if it suffers from the polymorphic class problem, in that the objects in the tree that are pointers to heap based objects (like pointers to a base class), aren't destroyed when nodes are deleted.
So, my options:
1: Use a tree of boost::shared_ptr, although this is more expensive/overkill than I'd like.
2: Write a little pointer wrapper like the one I've written below.  The idea being that it wraps a pointer, which when it goes out of scope, deletes its pointer.  It's not ref counted, it's just guarantees the pointer destruction.
3: Write my own allocator which allocates the node objects from a pool in the allocate() and deletes the pointed to memory in the deallocate().
4: Specialise the code to make a tree of pointers, avoiding the initial allocation and copy construction, plus innately knowing how to delete the pointed-to data. 
I already have option 2 working, but I'm not really happy with it, because I have to actually insert an empty ptr to begin with, then set() the pointer when the insert returns an iterator.  This is because the tree uses copy construction, and hence the temporary object passed on the stack will ultimate delete the pointer when it goes out of scope.  So I set the pointer upon return.  It works, it's hidden, but I don't like it.
Option 3 is looking like the best candidate, however I thought I'd ask if anyone else has already done this, or has any other suggestions?
Ok, I'ved decided to go with option 1 (tree of shared_ptrs), mainly because it's using standard libraries, but also because the extra refcount per node won't break the bank.  Thanks for the replies everyone :)
Cheers,
Shane

The tree is constructed without any problems, however, I run into some when I try to free the memory after being done with it.
In particularly, if I set up my constructor and destructor to be as such (where CNode.child is a pointer to an array of 10 pointers to other CNodes, and count is a simple unsigned int): 
I get a stack overflow when trying to delete the root node. I might be wrong, but I am fairly certain that this is due to too many destructor calls (each destructor calls up to 10 other destructors). I know this is suboptimal both space, and time-wise, however, this is supposed to be a quick-and-dirty solution to a the repeated substring problem.

The problem is that after creating about 1,100 files, fopen just returns NULL and stops creating new files. I can create further files manually in that directory, but using C++ it can not create any further files.
I know about max limit of inode on ext3 filesystem which is (from Wikipedia) 32,000 but mine is way less than that, also note that I can create files manually on the disk; just not through fopen.
Also, I really appreciate any idea regarding the best way to store a very dynamic quadtree on disk(I need the nodes to be in separate files and the quadtree might have a depth of 50).
Using nested directories is one idea, but I think it will slow down the performance because of following the links on the filesystem to access the file.

Ok, I've a data structure that consists of a matrix of linked nodes, lets say 10x10. I would like to be able to choose any of these nodes arbitrarily, and - from there - process a number of the surrounding nodes following the pattern of expanding concentric squares (I used less nodes below for illustration purposes). As far as specifics go, the implementation will be in Actionscript - but feel free to answer in another language :) - and it's for a minesweeper game (specifically the feature where, if clicking on a patch of mine-less squares, they -all- get cleared regardless of irregular shape, up to the surrounding mines). It will also be event based - dispatching one for each node traversed, so the way I imagine it is that when the iterator or whatever comes across a field containing a mine, traversal would stop from going further in that direction while the rest would continue. The nodes are doubly linked to their top, right, bottom, and left neighbors, and I wouldn't be opposed to adding more links if necessary. There's probably some other way to do it, but I can think of a number of uses for this kind of solution and would like to include it in a framework I'm creating, so I'd like to walk away with something I can reuse.

We need ADT having search and rank features.
That is, in addition to the interface of STL map, a function 'int get_rank(key)' is required.
Standard implementation of such function requires supporting and updating an extra integer field in every node of self-balanced searching tree (e.g., in black-red tree, used in STL map/set).
But it seems, STL map/set do not do this.
We're looking for a solution based on standard containers (STL, Boost) having the best possible Time Complexity:
  finding/adding/erasing an element take O(log n) (like in STL map/set), 
  computing the rank by a key takes also O(log n).
By the rank of an element, we mean the position of the element in the sorted sequence of all the elements of the map/set.
Example.
  set = {0, 4, 6, 7, 8}
  rank(0)=1, rank(4)=2, rank(6)=3, rank(7)=4, rank(8)=5.
In our opinion, under Time Complexity constrains above, the problem cannot be solved by a combination of two maps one sorting by key and other sorting by rank.

2) set is used to store and fetch elements by itself. map is used to store and fetch elements via key.

1913767,What's the fastest way to deserialize a tree in C++,"
I'm working with a not so small tree structure (it's a Burkhard-Keller-Tree, > 100 MB in memory) implemented in C++. The pointers to the children of each node are stored in a QHash. 
Each node x has n children y[1] ... y[n], the edges to the children are labeled with the edit distance d(x, y[i]), so using a hash to store the nodes is an obvious solution.
I also want to serialize and deserialize it into a file (I currently use a QDataStream). The tree is just built once and doesn't change then.
Building the tree and deserializing it is rather slow. I'm loading the tree in the obvious way: Recursively building each node. I think this is suboptimal due to the many nodes that are created seperately with the new operator. I read somewhere that new is pretty slow. The initial build is not a big problem because the tree's rather stable and doesn't have to be rebuilt very often. But loading the tree from a file should be as fast as possible.
What's the best way to accomplish this?
It must be much better to save the whole tree in a single memory block with adjacent nodes. Serializing and deserializing would then be reduced to save and load the whole block, which I have to allocate just once.
But to implement this I would have to re-implement the QHash, AFAIK. 
What would you do to speed up the deserialization?
Addendum
Thank you for your suggestion to do some profiling. Here are the results:
While rebuilding the tree from a file
So it's definitly not my new calls which cause the delay but the rebuild of the QHash objects at every node. This is basically done with:
Do I have to dig into QHash and look what's going on under the hood there? I think the best solution would be a hash object that can be serialized with a single read and write operation without the need to rebuild the internal data structure.

1877823,Most efficient tree structure for what I'm trying to do,"
I'm wondering what the most generally efficient tree structure would be for a collection that has the following requirements:

The tree will hold anywhere between 0 and 232 - 1 items.
Each item will be a simple structure, containing one 32-bit unsigned integer (the item's unique ID, which will be used as the tree value) and two pointers.
Items will be inserted and removed from the tree very often; some items in the tree will remain there for the duration of the program, while others will only be in the tree very briefly before being removed.
Once an item is removed, its unique ID (that 32-bit unsigned integer) will be recycled and reused for a new item.

The tree structure needs to support efficient inserts and deletions, as well as quick lookups by the unique ID. Also, finding the first available unused unique ID needs to be a fast operation.
What sort of tree would be best-suited for these requirements?
EDIT: This tree is going to be held only in memory; at no point will it be persisted to disk. I don't need to worry about hitting the disk, or disk caching, or anything of the sort. This is also why I'm not looking into using something like SQLite.

in C++ Template Metaprogramming : Concepts, Tools, and Techniques from Boost and Beyond

... One drawback of expression templates is that they tend to encourage writing  large, complicated expressions, because evaluation is only delayed until the assignment operator is invoked. If a programmer wants to reuse some intermediate result without evaluating it early, she may be forced to declare a complicated type like:


(or worse). Notice how this type not only exactly and redundantly reflects the structure of the computationand so would need to be maintained as the formula changes but also overwhelms it? This is a long-standing problem for C++ DSELs. The usual workaround is to capture the expression using type erasure, but in that case one pays for dynamic dispatching. There has been much discussion recently, spearheaded by Bjarne Stroustrup himself, about reusing the vestigial auto keyword to get type deduction in variable declarations, so that the above could be rewritten as:

1409006,State Machine Implementation,"
I'm looking for some general 

Optimization
Correctness
Extensibility

advice on my current C++ Hierarchical State Machine implementation.
Sample
Implementation
Currently, the HSM is implemented as a tree structure where each state can have a variable number of states as children.
Each state contains a variable number of ""override"" blocks (in a std::map) that override base values. At the root state, the state machine has a set of variables (functions, properties...) initialized to some default values. Each time we enter a child state, a list of ""overrides"" define variable and values that should replace the variables and values of the same name in the parent state. Updated original for clarity.
Referencing variables
At runtime, the current states are stored on a stack. 
Every time a variable is referenced, a downwards stack walk is performed looking for the highest override, or in the case of no overrides, the default value. 
Switching states
Each time a single state frame is switched to, the state is pushed onto a stack. 
Each time a state is switched to, I trace a tree descension that takes me from the current state to the root state. Then I do a tree descension from the target state to the root state  until I see the current trace matches the previous trace. I declare an intersection at where those 2 traces meet. Then, to switch to the target state, I descend from the source, popping state frames from the stack until I reach the intersection point. Then I ascend to the target node and push state frames onto the stack.
So for the code sample above
Execution trace for state switch

Source state = recording
Target State = alsoStreamToRemoteIp
descension from source = recording->root (trace = [root])
descension from target = alsoStreamToRemoteIp->playback->root (trace = [playback, root])
Intersects at root. 

To switch from recording to alsoStreamToRemoteIp, 

Pop ""recording"" from the stack (and call its exit function... not defined here). 
Push ""playback"" onto the stack (and call the enter function). 
Push ""alsoStreamToRemoteIp"" onto the stack (and call the the enter function).

A entity is an object created with attributes/methods of a given entity template. A entity may have a parent and/or a number of children.
Every entity template has a thread fragmentation cost and a computer fragmentation cost. They define how costly it will be to have children of that entity on different computers/thread from the parent
New entities will be assigned to a computer and a thread at the end of every iteration (via add) and old entities may be reassigned to a computer and a thread at the end of every N iteration (via defragment). 
When add is invoked, a entity is created and attached to a given parent. However, it still still has to be placed in a computer's thread's simulation runner. 
The factors deciding assignment are the child {computer|thread} fragmentation costs and optionally the fragmentation cost matrix.

Hi,
I'm just looking to get some ideas on a general direction/algorithm/field to solve the following problem.
I have N Entities (each with a possible parent and possible M children) in an iterative realtime simulation environment. Each entity is placed in a server environment where it is located on 1 computer and 1 thread on that computer. Each entity has a ""computer fragmentation cost"" and ""thread fragmentation cost"", which is a value from 0->1 (with 1 being the most expensive) that defines how painful/costly it will be to have that entity's children on different computers or threads. ""computer fragmentation cost"" will be higher than ""thread fragmentation cost"". 
I have 2 operation. A ""add"" operation that's executed when a entity is initially added. I also have a ""defragment"" operation that runs at the end of every Y iterations that relocates entities to different threads/computers.
What is a general algorithm/guideline that makes sure the fragmentation stays at a minimum for those 2 operations, given the fragmentation costs?
Also, each entity is created from a predefined template. There will be a matrix defining the fragmentation costs between every pair of entity template. How can this additional data be used to lower fragmentation?

181630,What's a good and stable C++ tree implementation?,"
I'm wondering if anyone can recommend a good C++ tree implementation, hopefully one that is 
stl compatible if at all possible.
For the record, I've written tree algorithms many times before, and I know it can be fun, but I want to be pragmatic and lazy if at all possible. So an actual link to a working solution is the goal here.
Note: I'm looking for a generic tree, not a balanced tree or a map/set, the structure itself and the connectivity of the tree is important in this case, not only the data within.
So each branch needs to be able to hold arbitrary amounts of data, and each branch should be separately iterateable.

7488896,Discrepencies between std::lower_bound and std::set::lower_bound,"
The C++ draft says about std::lower_bound:
Note that this allows (by implication) one to compare a different (but comparable) type than *ForwardIterator would return, but there's no complexity limitation on the number of iterator advancements.  (For a node based container, this would be O(last − first) iterator advancements.)
The standard doesn't detail these functions, but it's implied that these are for O(log2(last − first)) comparisons and advancements, but require the search key to be the same as the contained type.
So my questions are:
(1) Is there a way to get the speed of std::set::lower_bound and the flexibility of search type of std::lower_bound?
(2) Why isn't std::lower_bound required to be specialized for std::set::iterator?
(3) Are there implementations where std::lower_bound is specialized for std::set::iterator, or is there a reason why not?
I was hoping to find something like:
or:
But I doubt it exists.  Obviously, all of this can be expanded to other tree-based containers, and other algorithms.  I'd code it myself, but it would require me to use implementation specific code.  This idea came from this question: Efective search in set with non-key type

What is the best* way to implement this tree in C++, and what modifications may be needed to the classes to support it?
(*) I will leave the definition of ""best"" up to the community, be it ""fastest"", ""most efficient"", ""prettiest"", or whatever you like. I personally have a preference for simple and efficient, but I'm willing to sacrifice simplicity for performance if the gain is worthwhile. Also, if you're going to suggest BGL please try to give an example, or at least link to an article or specific section of the documentation that explains how to implement the tree.
Edit:
Since the question is a bit too generalized, I'll give a potential use case. In Linux, a filesystem (commonly) will sit atop either a bare partition, an MD array, or an LVM logical volume. Assume I want my classes to represent these structures and store metadata about them (device name, size, uuid, etc etc) for later retrieval, and that the base class has a set of virtual functions for refreshing and retrieving the metadata.
Now, let's say that my system has a disk layout like so:

[FS-/boot]

[ARR-md0]

[PART-sda1]
[PART-sdb1]


[FS-/]

[LV-root]

[VG-system]

[ARR-md1]

[PART-sda2]
[PART-sdb2]

I need to calculate the residual sum of squares for this) and the mapped value of cluspair which is pair of the class Cluster that I created. Map aims to store the F-test values between the all clusters so that I would not need to do the calculation again and again in every step. BTW cluster is a tree structure where every cluster contains two subclusters and the stored values are 70-dimensional vectors.
Problem is, in order to calculate the RSS, I need to implement a recursive code where I need to find the distance of every element of the cluster with the mean of the cluster and this seems to be consuming an enormous amount of memory. When I create the same map with the key values being the simple distance between the means of two clusters, the program uses minimal memory so I think the increase in the memory use is caused by the call of the recursive function RSS.

5808948,Merging leaves in an octree,"
I have a very large point cloud (> 100000 points) that I'd like to detect planar arrangements in. I decided to use an octree to break the points into very small planar clusters and then merge neighboring clusters that are coplanar. I have written code in C++ that quickly splits the point cloud into the small planar clusters, but how to effectively merge them is eluding me...
My Octree implementation uses a pointer structure: there are OctreeNodes with arrays OctreeNode* children[8] containing pointers to their child nodes, or all NULL pointers if it is a leaf node.
My first thought was to, in each OctreeNode object, keep a pointer to a Plane object. After splitting the points the first time, each leaf in the octree will get a Plane that represents the least-squares fit to all the points contained in the leaf. I then iterate over every leaf node in the tree. For each leaf node, I check each one of its neighbor leaf nodes: if the neighbor's plane should be merged with the current leaf's plane, I call Plane* newPlane = Plane::mergePlanes(this->plane, neighbor->plane); to create a new plane that represents the points in both nodes. 
This is where I've run into trouble... I first thought I could simply replace both planes with the new plane, i.e. plane = newPlane; neighbor->plane = newPlane; and be done (memory leaks aside; I handled them in the real code). Unfortunately, this doesn't work in practice. After merging several planes, there may be several different OctreeNodes pointing to a single Plane, and simply replacing the pointers in this->plane and neighbor->plane doesn't replace EVERY pointer that is pointing to their old planes.
The solution seemed hackish even when I first came up with it, and now its flaws are even more clear. Can anyone think of a way to fix the merging method I came up with, or think of a better one?
Thank you

5797769,keeping track of changing pointers,"
I have a red black tree algorithm which is working fine.  When a node is inserted into the tree, the insert() method returns to the caller a pointer to the node that was inserted.  I store all such pointers in a STL vector.
The problem is, within the operation of the RB tree, sometimes these pointers are invalidated.  For instance, there is a method that is called during a rotateleft/right that copies the values of node A into the current node and then deletes node A.  Well I had a pointer to node A in that vector which is now invalid.
I thought about making a way to update the pointers in the vector as follows,
1) keep a multimap which maps node pointers to the vector indices that holds those pointers.
2) Before deleting a node, check this multimap to find all the spots in the vector that will be affected
3)  iterate over the vector and change the old pointer to the new pointer
4)  Update the key value in the multimap to reflect the new pointer as well.
Problem is, you can't update a key value of a map collection for obvious reasons.  Also this seems like a horrible solution both for complexity and implementation reasons.  Any ideas on how I can accomplish this dynamic updating of pointers?
